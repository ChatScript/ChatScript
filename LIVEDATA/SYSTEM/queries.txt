# OVERVIEW OF THE BYTE_CODE QUERY LANGUAGE

# This defines byte-code query operators.
# The first word is always the name of the query. The rest are byte-code commands to be carried out.
# A query consists of a series of segments that perform specific kinds of actions.
# The potential argument words to a query are the: subject field, verb field, object field, propogate field, match field, and the from factset.

# These characters are not commands:
#		_ or . or a space = just a separator to make things easier to read.
#		: = terminate a segment command, start of next segment command

# The basic kinds operations the commands perform are:
#   1. tag some words - there can be a variety of different tags. Some say to accept. Some say to reject.
#   2. queue some words or facts to be processed further (scanned)
#   3. scan facts tied to words or facts to accept or reject them
#   4. queue some resulting facts

# Tags on words are used to:
#  1. avoid scanning from the same word more than once
#  2. detect successful words (end of the line of a search or acceptance for queuing for further search)
#  3. detect failure words (words to NOT access)

# The first segment describes what to initially tag and initially queue for processing (sources of facts)
#	Values:
#		1..9  = set global tag to this label - 0 means turn off global tag. The current global tag is used when tagging a word or fact
#		i =  use argument tag on words to ignore during a tag or queue operation 
#			Next char is tag label. 0 means no ignoretag
#		s/v/o/p/m/~set/'word  = use a specific argument field: subject/verb/object/progogate/match/factset,named ~set,named word 
#		S/V/O choice is a fact id
#			The above is automatically taged using the current tag and is followed by 
#				q  = queue items (sets will follow to all members recursively and wordnet will look at synonyms)
#				Q  = queue this exact item only
#				t  = tag(no queue) items
#				e  = expand tag(no queue) propogate down any set argument
#				< and >  = tagpropogation on nouns from base. < means propogate up (from left subject to object). > means propogate down (from right object to subject) - Warning: down propogation might be large
#					for subject/object position propogation only NOUNS are considered. for verb position only VERBS are considered.	
#				1ST char after < > is tag on verbs to propogate thru
#					2nd char is t or q (for tag or tag/queue)
#
#		S/V/O	= use corresponding subject/verb/object as a fact index to q (must use f in segment 2)
#		n = 	pay no attention to facts with a topic name as the object	
#		f = use given facts in fromset as items to process -- f@n  means use this 1-digit set
#			This is followed by 
#			s/v/o/f	= use corresponding field of fact or entire fact
#		the value to process will be tagged AND may or may not get stored, depending on following flag being q or m

# The second segment (queue) tells how to use contents of the queue,  that is, given a word, which field to use to get facts
#		or given a fact, just to use it directly.
#		s/v/o/f	= use corresponding subject/verb/object field of an item as source of facts or use fact alone directly
#		e = used with f, means use the fact exclusively, dont follow any field out of it

# third segment (match) tells how to detect facts that match. 
# set tags to compare on (test criteria for saving an answer)
#		q	= use this word label to tag items added to queue
#       	! = next thing (svo) is ignore, not match
#		s/v/o	=  test corresponding subject/verb/object field of fact 
#			Next character gives label to use 0-9 for testing or the letter t means is it a topic name 
#			t = check object to see if it is a topic name (for indexing things by topic). fact store is xxx member ~topicname - make sure VERB fails (like use the propogation verbs)
#		i =	 set ignore tag (for any propogation)
#		< >	= propogate outward from queued item - < means propogate up/left-to-right    > means propogate down/right-to-left (subject)
#			This is followed by
#			1st char is verb tag to follow out
#		~	= stop on intersection 
#			followed by char label to intersect
#		f   = fact must have flag given by match variable
#		>= range above (use propgate field)
#		<= range below (use match field)
#
# Facts that match will either become result facts OR, if this is a riccochet search, will stimulate further processing.

# fourth segment( walk) how to take matching facts and migrate around the graph and save new queue entries using it instead of returning it as a result.
#	s/o	 =  1st reference to one of these is which field of initial fact provides the riccochet value
#   s/o  =  2nd reference to one of this is given riccochet value, should be it as subject or object of the fact. 
#	S/V/O	= test riccochet fact for corresponding label immediately followed by id 0-9 of test value

#######
## A riccochet match finds a fact one of whose fields is a fact or can be used to find facts. 
#  It then examines a field of that fact or facts to match it and return some other piece of it.
# E.g.
# If you have facts like (Nixon instance ~president) and (37 exemplary Nixon)  meaning Nixon was the 37th president, and the  question was "who was the 37th president"
# one could do two searches, i.e., get all people who were presidents, then find which one was 37th, but that means saving into a set all of the
# first search before doing the second. A riccochet search performs the second search on each result of the first search as it finds matches, so it never stores a large initial
# result.
# So, you tell the system for a given initial fact whether to base riccochet on the subject or object field. And you tell it whether the entry should be the subject or object
# field of the riccochet fact.
