# nouns occur# 1. as subject or indirect object or object of a main clause, subordinate clause, coordinate sentence
# 2. as object or indirect object of a verbal (noun-infinitive, gerund, or adjective participle)
# 3. noun functioning as adjective in front of another noun (labeled adjective_noun)
# 4. at front, in middle, or at end, separated by commas, as address
# 5. after another noun (with some header when not proper) with or without commas as appositive
# 6. as object of a preposition
# 7. before comma or and as part of list
# 8. before possessive which is before upcoming noun (a determiner) 
# 9. after To-infinitive (we label verb infinitive as noun-infinitive)
# 10. as gerund 
# 11 beware capitalized adjectives before lower case noun...
# 12 as object complement - simiolar to appositive- I called my cat Garfield or we elected Tim president
# 1s as subject complement after a linking verb - "he was a cat"
# 13 noun functioning as adjunct adverbial: time word actually labelled as adverb, usually at start of sentence separated by comma or at end of sentence with no comma  "five years ago, I walked"
#	  also object name giving location - "I walked home"
# 14 subject of appositive phrase:  // "wings flapping", the man runs   where verb is ing verb

# subject may be omitted in a clause when subject is the same as rest of sentence
# subject (pronoun) may be omitted when [you] is implied via a command
# object (pronouns) may be wrapped when sentence ends in a preposition and its object starts the sentence - "where did you come from?"

# cannot have noun before known possessive if we never had a verb (which could use 2 objects) "what *will my dog do"  but - "to those allies *whose culture we love"

# cant be noun if followed by determiner and no verb before = this/a (Pronoun_subject Determiner)  gives/give (Noun_plural Verb_present_3ps)  the/a (Determiner)   = would need comma "in this house, the"
