# Fundmentals of Meaning

* No intrinsic meaning. Language is agreement.


* Consists of:
  * Words, grammar, punctuation
  * Context
  * topic of conversation - _the bat flew out of his hands_
  * prior sentence in volley: _I like apples. Do you?_
  * Prior sentence in prior volley - _Do you like apples? Yes._
  * Words in nearby sentences - pronoun resolution
  * Idioms/Phrases - :) _what do you do?_

---

# Fundamentals of ChatScript Script

* Rules
* Topics
* Keywords
* Concepts
* Comments
  - `#` for user comments
  - `#!` for ChatScript directive comments
  - `##<<` and `##>>` for block comments

---

# Rules

* The basis for all meaning detection and action.
* Fundamentally an IF/THEN statement.
* 4 parts:
  * _kind_ - what types of sentences does it reply to
  * _label_ - way for other rules to refer to it
  * _pattern_ - IF test for allowing output to execute
  * _output_ - THEN part for taking action
```  
u: MYRULE ( I love meat) So do I.
```
      
---

# Kinds of rules

* _Responders_ - react to user input
  * `?:` - responds to questions from user
  * `s:` - responds to statements from user
  * `u:` - responds to union of questions and statements

* _Gambits_ - program says when it has sente
```
  t: Have you ever had a pet?
```

* _Rejoinders_ - based on what we just said to user
```
a: (yes) What kind of pet?
  b: (dog) I like dogs.
  b: (cat) I prefer dogs.
a: (no) Pets are fun. You should try having one.
```

* `v:` - void rule that is the target only of ^reuse and ^refine
```
  t: Have you ever had a pet?
    a: (~yes) ^reuse(STANDARD_YES)
 v: STANDARD_YES() That's nice.'
```
---

# Questions about sentence kinds

* What if user omits punctuation?
<br>  System infers it from sentence structure, words.

* What is a command?
<br>  By default a statement. But script can remap them
<br>  to be questions: _Describe an elephant_ is like _What is an elephant?_

* What about exclamations?
<br>  They are statements. You can match `!` in patterns.

---

# Patterns

* Patterns detect meaning.
* Constrains when the output of a rule can fire.
* Patterns are like regular expressions, but for meaning instead of characters.
* Patterns consist of tokens separated by spaces rather than letters all jammed together.

---

# Output

* Executed if a rule's pattern matches
  - Can be simple text
```
?: ( << you ~like pizza >>) I love pizza.
```
  - Can be random text
```
?: ( << you ~like pizza >>) [Of course][Absolutely] I [love it.][ adore it.]
```

* Text autoformats
  - Can be code and text intermix or code only
```  
?: ( << what you age >>) I am ^compute(%year - 1989) years old.
```

* Rule output is discarded if code fails in a rule

---

# Agenda - Patterns in depth

* Section 0 - Introduction

* Section 1 Fundamentals of Scripting
  * Overview of Meaning / ChatScript
  * __Patterns in depth__
  * Topics, Output, Data, Functions

* Section 2 How does the engine work

---

# Patterns in Depth

* Generally done on the current sentence
* Tokens are instructions to process, left to right.
```
#! what is my name
?: ( what is my name) - simple pattern
```

* # grab indicated letter if we have a phone number
```
u: LETTERS($$phone @_10+ _*1 ) - esoteric pattern
```
---

# Simple Pattern Match

* Match words in sentence
```
u: (I love pizza)
```
match: _I love pizza_, _I will love pizza_

* Pattern words cased as they should be
```
u: ( I love pizza from Pizza Hut) 
```        
match: _i love pizza from pizza hut_, _I LOVE PIZZA FROM PIZZA HUT_, _i LOVE pizza From pizza Hut_

---

# Pattern Problem

* Linear sequences not scalable.
* AIML improved this by:
  - eliminate case - all upper case (losing useful data)
  - eliminate punctuation (losing useful data)
  - adding wildcard * to match 1 or more words
```
I * LOVE * YOU
```
---

# AIML Problem

* Requires match of entire input sentence.
* Needs 4 patterns to match.

        WORD . WORD
        * WORD ... WORD
        WORD ... WORD *
        WORD ... WORD *

* 2015 AIML's 1 st revision in 20 years. Provides wildcard matching 0 or more words.

      * WORD ... WORD *

---

# Patterns- CS canonical forms

* Input creates 2 sentences - original + canonical

* Matching looks at both
  - nouns: _bicycles_ -> _bicycle_
  - verbs: _were_ -> _be_
  - numbers: _two_ -> _2_ _2.0_ -> _2_ _two thousand and fifty_ -> _2050_
  - determiners: _the_ -> _a_
  - personal pronouns: _my_ -> _I him_ -> _he whom_ -> _who_
```
u: (I love pizza) 
```
matches: _I loved pizza_, _me loves pizzas_

---

# Patterns - Canonical forms

* Can require original form only using `'`
```
u: ( 'I 'love 'pizza)
```

* Can require original form if not canonical
```
u: ( I loved pizzas)
```
matches: _me love pizza_, _me loved pizzas_

---

# Patterns - bags of words

* `[` `]` - find one
```
u: ( I love [ pizza bacon sausage hamburger])
```

* `{` `}` - maybe find one
```
u: ( I love {the my} moon )
```

* `<<` `>>` - find all in any order anywhere

```
u: ( << pizza I love >> )
```
Particularly important. Breaks the straight-jacket of sequence.

---

# Patterns - composed bags
```
u: ( << I [like love adore] [pizza bacon] >>) So do I.
```
matches: _I love bacon_, _Pizza is what I adore_, _I hate pizza but love rocks_
```
u: ( I love [ meat << flesh animal >> ] ) So do I.
```
matches: _I love meat_, _I love animal flesh_, _I love the flesh of an animal_

---

# Pattern - wildcards

* Keeping sequence but not requiring contiguity

* `*` - any number of words (including 0)

```
u: ( I love * pizza) - matches "I love spicy pepperoni pizza"
```
but matches _I love you and hate pizza_ - still a flaw with AIML

* `*1` - 1 word exactly `*2`, `*3` ..

```
u: ( I love *1 pizza)
```
matches _I love pepperoni pizza_

* `*~1` - 0 or 1 word `*~2`, `*~3` ..

```
u: ( I *~2 love *~2 pizza) ?? examples?
```
But _I do not love pizza_ is a problem.

---

# Patterns - exclusions

`!` - make sure this not seen later in sentence

    u: (!not I *~2 love *~2 pizza)
    u: (!not !pepperoni I *~2 love *~2 pizza)
    u: (![not pepperoni] I *~2 love *~2 pizza)

---

# Patterns- Phrases

* Phrase = sequence of 1-5 words in `"` `"` 
```
u: ( I * work * "International Business Machines")
```
How is this different from
```
u: (I * work * International Business Machines )
```
The phrase is a single idea, an entity. Your pattern should
reflect that. Humans will understand your pattern better. And CS
will handle it correctly against a range of tokenization options.
Particularly if it involves periods and commas
```
u: (I * live * “Raleigh, North Carolina”)
```
---

# Patterns - Concepts

A concept set is a bag of words.

    concept: ~like (like adore love lust "be big on" )

Can be used in patterns in place of words.
Same canonical rules as patterns, ' or not.

    u: (!~negativeWords << I ~like ~nutrient >>)

This rule captures a probable meaning
_I like some kind of food or drink_
Can still go wrong. Rules are not perfect.

---

# Patterns - memorization
`_` - memorize word of input
Auto assigned match variable numbering.

    u: ( I * love * _~nutrient) I love _0 too.

Stores original, canonical, and position.

    u: ( I * _~like * _~nutrient) I love '_1 too.
    u: ( I like _{~pizzaToppings} pizza)

_I like pizza_ -> `_0` is null, _I like pepperoni pizza_ -> `_0` is pepperoni

---

# Patterns - comparisons

* Can test relationships `>` `<` `==` `!=`
```
u: ( _~number _0==3) # relatively pointless since u: (3) is equivalent
u: ( _~number _0>0 _0<10)
```    

* Can test concept membership `?` `!?`

```
u: ( _~animals _0?~pets)
```

* Can test bit patterns `&` `^`

```
u: (_~number _0&1)
```

* Can test existence (not null)

```
u: ( I love _{pepperoni} pizza _0) - but a pointless pattern here
```
---

# Patterns - tag-along patterns

Output requests more matching via `^refine()`.
Acts like a switch statement, only 1 can match.

    u: ( I ~like _~nutrient) ^refine()
      a: (_0?~dessert) I love brownies.
      a: (_0?~meat) I like steak.
      a: (_0?~beverage) I drink tea.
      a: () All food is good.

---

# Patterns - esoteric

Be aware:

* You can match forwards and/or backwards
* You can jump around in the sentence.
* You can match partial spellings of words.

```
u: ( my sign is Sagitt* )
```

* You can hide or add concept meanings

```
u: ( _coffee ~nutrient) ^unmark(~color _0)
```
_I like coffee ice cream_ -> coffee is not a color

* Force alignment to start or end of sentence

```
u: ( < ice is nice > ) ice is 1 st word of sentence, nice is last word
```

# Agenda - Topics, Output, Data, Functions

* Section 0 - Introduction

* Section 1 Fundamentals of Scripting
  * Overview of Meaning / ChatScript
  * Patterns in depth
  * __Topics, Output, Data, Functions__

* Section 2 How does the engine work

---

# Topics

A named collection of rules tried in order
Can have keywords to find or invoked by name
Has properties like don't erase, allow repeat

    topic: ~funerals repeat (die death burial funeral)
    ?: ( will you ever die ) Not soon I hope
    t: have you ever been to a funeral?
      a: (yes) Did you enjoy it?
    t: I have. It was boring.

Use relevant keyword (! prepositions/pronouns)

---

# Data - variables

* Match variables from memorization like _0
* User variables like $var

      $var = _0 -> single $ are permanent
      $$tmp = 20 -> double $$ last for the volley only

* Read-only system variables like %time

---

# Data

* All data is text.
* Digit text autoconverts to numbers as needed.
* Active Strings `^"The answer is $answer."`

Convert on use into simple text Is not autoformatted

---

# Data - facts

* A triple of relationship information

      (you age 23)
      ("The Wind and the Willows" author "Kenneth Grahame")

* Represents internals using member and is

      (black member ~colors) - CS representation of a concept
      (Laborador~1 is dog~2) - Wordnet relationship of word meanings

* Can query for facts given one or more fields

---

# Facts- Tables

* Can define tables of data to process into fact.
* Processing happens at build time
* Efficient scripting- all elaborate patterns in common topic
```
table: ^favetable(~foods)
chocolate candy    "I love Cadbury's Flake chocolate bar."
Easter    candy    "I love marshmallow bunnies."
[salad _] dressing "I prefer sweet dressings to sour ones."
pizza     topping  "My favorite pizza topping is pepperoni because I like meat."
comfort   food     "My favorite comfort food is is a Gruyere cheese toastie."
_         pizza    "My favorite pizza is pepperoni because I like pizza with meat toppings."
```
---

# Data - JSON

* Classic JSON data used in web calls
* Represented internally as facts
* Functions to create, query, etc.

---

# Functions

* Classic functions with arguments start with `^`

```
$$tmp = ^pick(~animals)
```

* Call by reference
* Variety of predefined functions
* Can define user functions for patterns or output
* Most useful are:
```
^gambit(~topic), ^respond(~topic)
^refine(), ^reuse(label)
```
---

# Functions vs Rules vs Topics

* Executes script vs Matches patterns, Functions Rules vs Rules Script (via If)

* Can be called - Functions (with args) Rules (0 args)

So how are they different? They barely are.

* Rules are separately labelled
* Topics can be invoked by association (keyword)
* Rules stop when output is generated
* Functions & Rules execute to completion

---

# Std Engine Control Flow

* A control topic manages engine execution.
* Below default engine behavior can be altered.
* Input volley is processed sentence by sentence
* Rule execution is top to bottom in a topic
* Rules can invoke topics or other rules
* New rules tried until user output is generated.
* Rules erase after generating user output
* Rules decline to repeat output close together

# Agenda - What is the NL pipeline

* Section 0 - Introduction
* Section 1 Fundamentals of Scripting
* Section 2 How does the engine work
  - __What is the NL pipeline__
  - How does the engine work

---

# Natural Language (NL) Pipeline

1. Process characters into words/sentences

2. Apply standard transformations
   - adjust case ( _i_->_I_ )British → American
   - expand contractions texting → American
   - spell correction dialog act conversion
   - remove end punctuation interjection splitting
   - merge dates, numbers, proper nouns
   - substitutions (_FB_ -> _Facebook_, _1am_ → _1 am_)
   - separation (_5'11”_ → _5 foot 11 inch_, _Bob's_ → _Bob 's_)
   - remove noise (_anonymous strangerv -> _stranger_)

---

# NL Pipeline

3. Part-of-Speech tagging and parsing
4. Dual stream of original and canonical words
5. Mark words with what concepts and where

All stored in dictionary for hash lookup.

Can use `:prepare` to see results or `:trace`

Now ready to execute script.

# Agenda - How does the engine work

* Section 0 - Introduction
* Section 1 Fundamentals of Scripting
* Section 2 How does the engine work
  * What is the NL pipeline
  * __How does the engine work__

---

# CS Design Goals

* Low memory - runnable locally in cellphone
* High speed - runnable on weak processors
* Concise - rules take few characters
* Precise - can represent specific meanings
* General - beyond chat, general NL tool
* Commercial grade
  - scaleable
  - script testing and analytic support
  - Well documented

---

# Engine sequencing

* Startup load dictionary, layer 0, layer 1
* Read user input (username + botname + input)
* Read in user topic file
* Run NL pipeline
* Run Script
* Write changed user topic file back
* Send output to user

---

# Dictionary

* Every word, phrase, fact value, concept name, function name, etc stored in hashtable
* Lower & uppercase words have same hash
* Uppercase words use next bucket up
* Enables case-based lookups of same word
* New words from user go into reserved bucket
* Are ripped back at end of volley
* Every word has lists of facts using it as S V O
* Enables query by field value
* Facts also have lists of facts using it as S V O

---

# Marking

* Dictionary entry for every word, phrase, concept
* Words have timestamp + loc. in sentence.
* Words have lists of facts they participate in.
* Marking takes original/canonical word
* Fills in location in sentence
* Propagates from facts in which word is subject
* using member & is to object of fact and marks that
* Propagate restricted by POS or Wordnet meaning
* Pattern test can then look up word for status

---

# Memory Management

* No dynamic malloc/free

* Mark/release per volley, no interim release

* Memory pre-allocated to pools of:
  - Dictionary entries
  - Facts
  - String space
  - Buffers (buffer pool array, not mark-release)
  
* Facts & Words inter-locked, unpeel to release

---

# Script Control

Bot definition assigns topics to variables.
Only `$cs_controlmain` is required.

* `$cs_controlpre` - once per volley at start
* `$cs_prepass` - once per sentence
* `$cs_controlmain` - once per sentence
* `$cs_controlpost` - once per volley at end

---

# Simple Control Topic

The Harry control flow processes sentences
until a single output is generated. Does this:

* See if rejoinder matches
* Respond in current topic
* Respond in other topics based on keyword.
* Respond from keywordless topic.
* Quibble sometimes.
* Gambit from current topic.
* Gambit from other topics based on keyword.
* Gambit from any topic.

---

# Error Handling

All functions return 2 things:

* Output - is either assigned or dumped to user
  - `^myfunction(_0)` - result seen in user output
  - `$var = ^myfunction(_0)` - result stored on variable

* Error code - tells how to proceed
  - `NoProblem`
  - `FailRule` `FailTopic` `FailInput` `FailSentence`
  - `EndRule` `EndTopic` `EndSentence` `EndInput`
  - `RetryRule` `RetryTopic` `RetrySentence` `RetryInput`

---

# Out-of-band data

ChatScript manages 2 channels of data

* Input and output with the user
* Input and output with the application

* Application data (OOB) in `[``]` first.
```
[category: vet specialty: cat] Hi, I'm Rosa.
[callback: 600] My name is Pearl.
```

* Application responsible for handling `[``]` in output
* Script responsible for handling `[``]` in input
* Engine aware of `[``]`, does not apply NL pipeline

---

# `^`Function Support

* API routines for:
* Manipulating topics 
* Word manipulation
* Marking and parsing 
* Manipulating facts
* Input control 
* Manipulating JSON
* Manipulating numbers 
* Debugging
* Output generation and access Postgres DB use
* Controlling flow

---

# ChatScript Server

* One thread devoted to CS main engine
* Other threads accept and read input
* Then queue for engine service
* Then handle output and file writing
* Can run server on each core, tied to same port.
* Server is CPU bound.

---

# `:` Command Support

* Testing and display- `:trace`, `:testpattern`
* Proving your code works- `:verify`, `:regress`
* Analytics on logs- `:trim` `:abstract`
* Document reading- `:document`
* Word information- `:up`, `:down`, `:word`, `:prepare`
* Control- `:build`, `:restart`, `:reset`
* Topic data- `:topicstats`, `:topicinfo`
* and lots more

---

* Basic + advanced User manuals
* System functions (API guide)
* JSON, facts
* System variables and Engine-defined concepts
* Finalizing a bot
* Debugging
* Papers on history and theory of ChatScript/chat
