# Engine-defined concepts

In addition to concepts defined in script files, the system automatically defines a bunch of
dictionary-based sets as well as dynamically computed concept members.

| set              | description 
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ 
| `~web_url`       | word is a web url 
| `~email_url`     | word is an email address 
| `~kindergarten`  | word learned early in life
| `~grade1_2`      | word learned in these grades
| `~grade3_4`      | word learned in these grades
| `~grade_5-6`     | word learned in these grades. Unmarked words are learned even later 
| `~utf8`          | word has nonascii characters
| `~daynumber`     | word could be a number of a day in a month
| `~yearnumber`    | word could be the number of a recent year
| `~dateinfo`      | phrase is month day year of some kind
| `~kelvin`        | temperature marker
| `~celcius`       | temperature marker
| `~fahrenheit`    | temperature marker
| `~twitter_name`  | twitter user name
| `~hashtag_label` | twitter topic reference

## Interjections, "discourse acts", and concept sets

Some words and phrases have interpretations based on whether they are at sentence start
or not. E.g., _good day, mate_ and _It is a good day_ are different for _good day_. 

Likewise _sure_ and _I am sure_ are different. 

Words that have a different meaning at the start of a sentence are commonly called interjections. 

In ChatScript these are defined by the `livedata/interjections.txt` file. 
In addition, the file augments this concept with "discourse acts", phrases that are like an interjection. 
All interjections and discourse acts map to concept sets, 
which come thru as the user input instead of what they wrote. 

For example _yes_ and _sure_ and _of course_ are all treated as meaning the discourse act 
of agreement in the interjections file. So you don’t see _yes, I will go_ coming out of the engine. 

The interjections file will remap that to the sentence `~yes`, 
breaking off that into its own sentence, followed by _I will go_ as a new sentence.

These generic interjections (which are open to author control via interjections.txt) are:

| interjection        | description
| ------------------- | ------------ 
| `~yes`              |
| `~no`               |
| `~emomaybe`         |
| `~emohello`         |
| `~emogoodbye`       |
| `~emohowzit`        |
| `~emothanks`        |
| `~emolaugh`         |
| `~emohappy`         |
| `~emosad`           |
| `~emosurprise`      |
| `~emomisunderstand` |
| `~emoskeptic`       |
| `~emoignorance`     |
| `~emobeg`           |
| `~emobored`         |
| `~emopain`          |
| `~emoangry`         |
| `~emocurse`         |
| `~emodisgust`       |
| `~emoprotest`       |
| `~emoapology`       |
| `~emomutual`        |

Because all interjections at the start of a sentence are broken off into their own sentence,
this kind of pattern does not work:

    u: (~yes _*)

You cannot capture the rest of the sentence here, 
because it will be part of the next sentence instead. 
This means interjections act somewhat differently from other concepts.

If you use a word in a pattern which may get remapped on input, 
the script compiler will issue a warning. Likely you should use the remapped name instead.

The following concepts are triggered by exactly repeating either the chatbot or oneself 
(to a repeat count of how often repeated). Repeats are within a recency window of about 20 volleys.

| concept         | description
| --------------- | -------------- 
| `~repeatme`     |
| `~repeatinput1` |
| `~repeatinput2` |
| `~repeatinput3` |
| `~repeatinput4` |
| `~repeatinput5` | 
| `~repeatinput6` |


## POS (Part of Speech) Tags

Words will have pos-tags attached, specififying both generic and specific tag attributes, eg., `~noun`, `~noun_singular`.

### Generic Specifics
| nouns                     | description 
| ------------------------- | -------------- 
| `~noun`                   |
| `~noun_singular`          | 
| `~noun_plural`            |
| `~noun_proper_singular`   |
| `~noun_proper_plural`     |
| `~noun_gerund`            |
| `~noun_number`            |
| `~noun_infinitive`        |
| `~noun_omitted_adjective` |

| verbs                     | description 
| ------------------------- | -------------- 
| `~verb`                   |
| `~verb_present`           |
| `~verb_present_3ps`       |
| `~verb_infinitive`        |
| `~verb_present_participle`|
| `~verb_past`              |
| `~verb_past_participle`   |
| `~aux_verb`               |
| `~aux_verb_present`       |
| `~aux_verb_past`          |
| `~aux_verb_future`        |
| `~aux_verb_tenses`        |
| `~aux_be`                 |
| `~aux_have`               |
| `~aux_do`                 |

Auxilliary verbs are segmented into normal ones and special ones. Normal ones give their
tense directly. Special ones give their root word. The tense of the be/have/do verbs can be
had via `^properties()` and testing for verb tenses

| adjectives                | description
| ------------------------- | -------------- 
| `~adjective`              |
| `~adjective_normal`       |
| `~adjective_number`       |
| `~adjective_noun`         |
| `~adjective_participle`   |


| adjectives in comparative form | description 
| ------------------------------ | -------------- 
| `~more_form`<br>`~most_form`   |
| `~adverb`                      |
| `~adverb_normal`               |

| adverbs in comparative form    | description  
| ------------------------------ | -------------- 
| `~more_form`<br>`~most_form`   |
| `~pronoun`<br>`~pronoun_subject`<br>`~pronoun_object` |
| `~conjunction_bits`<br>`~conjunction_coordinate`<br>`~conjunction_subordinate` |
| `~determiner_bits`<br>`~determiner`<br>`~pronoun_possessive`<br>`~predeterminer` |
| `~possessive`                  | covers _'_ and _'s_ at end of word
| `~to_infinitive`               | "to" when used before a noun infinitive
| `~preposition`<br>`~particle`  | free-floating preposition tied to idiomatic verb
| `~comma`                       |
| `~quote`                       | covers _'_ and _"_ when not embedded in a word
| `~paren`                       | covers opening and closing parens
| `~foreign_word`                | some unknown word
| `~there_existential`           | the word there used existentially

In addition to normal generic kinds of pos tags, words which are serving a pos-tag role
different from their putative word type are marked as members of the major tag they act
as part of. E.g,

|                                | description  
| ------------------------------ | -------------- 
| `~noun_gerund`                 | verb used as a ~noun
| `~noun_infinitive`             | verb used as a ~noun
| `~noun_omitted_adjective`      | an adjective used as a collective noun (eg _the beautiful are kind_)
| `~adjectival_noun`             | noun used as adjective like bank "bank teller"
| `~adjective_participle`        | verb participle used as an adjective

For `~noun_gerund` in _I like swimming_ the verb gerund _swimming_ is treated as a noun
(hence called noun-gerund) but retains verb sense when matching keywords tagged with
part-of-speech (i.e., it would match `swim~v` as well as `swim~n`).

Additionally, there is 

|                        | description  
| ---------------------- | -------------- 
| `~number`              | is not a part of speech, but is comprise of `~noun_number` (a normal number value like _17_ or _seventeen_) 
| `~adjective_number`    | also a normal numeral value and also `~placenumber`) like _first_. 
| `~integer`             |               
| `~float`               |
| `~positiveinteger`     |
| `~negativeinteger`     |
| `~modelnumber`         | not a true number, but a word with both alpha and numeric

To can be a preposition or it can be special. When used in the infinitive phrase To go, it is
marked `~to_infinitive` and is followed by `~noun_infinitive`.

|                        | description  
| ---------------------- | -------------- 
|  `~verb_infinitive`    | refers to a match on the infinitive form of the verb (_I hear John sing_ or _I will sing_).
| `~There_existential`   | refers to the use of where not involving location, meaning the existence of, as in There is no future.
| `~Particle`            | refers to a preposition piece of a compound verb idiom which allows being separated from the verb. If you say _I will call off the meeting_, call_off is the composite verb and is a single token. But if you split it as in _I will call the meeting off_, then there are two tokens. The original form of the verb will be call and the canonical form of the verb will be call_off, while the free-standing off will be labeled `~particle`.
| `~verb_present`        | will be used for normal present verbs not in third person singular like _I walk_ and 
| `~verb_present_3ps`    | will be used for things like _he walks_
| `~possesive`           | refers to _‘s_ and _‘_ that indicate possession, while possessive pronouns get their own labeling `~pronoun_possessive`.
| `~pronoun_subject`     | is a pronoun used as a subject (like _he_) 
| `~pronoun_object`      | refers to objective form like _him_

Individual words serve roles in the parse of a sentence, which are retrievable. These
include:

|                        | description  
| ---------------------- | -------------- 
| `~mainsubject`         |
| `~mainverb`            |
| `~mainindirect`        |
| `~maindirect`          |
| `~subject2`            |
| `~verb2`               |
| `~indirectobject2`     |
| `~object2`             |
| `~subject_complement`  | adjective object of sentence involving linking verb
| `~object_complement`   | 2ndary noun or infinitive verb filling modifying mainobject or object2
| `~conjunct_noun`<br>`~conjunct_verb`<br>`~conjunct_adjective`<br>`~conjunct_adverb`<br>`~conjunct_phrase`<br>`~conjunct_clause`<br>`~conjunct_sentence`          |
| `~postnominalAdjective`| adjective occuring AFTER the noun it modified
| `~reflexive`           | reflexive pronouns
| `~not`                 |
| `~address`             | noun used as addressee of sentence
| `~appositive`          | noun restating and modifying prior noun
| `~absolutephrase`      | special phrase describing whole sentence
| `~omittedtimeprep`     | modified time word used as phrase but lacking preposition (_Next tuesday I will go_)
| `~phrase`              | a prepositional phrase start (except
| `~clause`              | a subordinate clause start 
| `~verbal`              | a verb phrase

and special concepts:
| `~capacronym`           | word is in all caps (and &) and is likely an acronym

# System Variables

The system has some predefined variables which you can generally test and use but not
normally assign to. These all begin with `%` . Ones that are reasonable to set are written in
bold underline. Boolean values are always `1` or `null` on returns. `1` or `0` if you are
setting them. 

## Date & Time & Numbers

| variable            | description                                    |
| --------            | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `%date`             | one or two digit day of the month 
| `%day`              |Sunday, etc
| `%daynumber`        | 1-7 where 1 = Sunday
| `%fulltime`         | seconds representing the current time and date (Unix epoch time) 
| `%hour`             |  0-23
| `%timenumbers`      | completely consistent full time info in numbers that you can do <br>`_0 = ^burst(%timenumbers)`to get  `_0` =seconds (2digit) <br>`_1`=minutes (2digit) <br>`_2`=hours (2digit) <br>`_3`=dayinweek(0-6 Sunday=0) <br>`_4`=dateinmonth (1-31) <br>`_5`=month(0-11 January=0) <br>`_6`=year.<br>You need to get it simultaneously if you want to do accurate things with current time, since retrieving %hour %minute separately allows time to change between calls 
| `%leapyear`         | boolean if current year is a leap year 
| `%daylightsavings`  | boolean if current within daylight savings
| `%minute`           | 0-59 
| `%month`            |1-12 (January = 1)
| `%monthname`        | January, etc
| `%second`           | 0-59
| `%volleytime`       | number of seconds of computation since volley input started 
| `%time`             | hh:mm in military 24-hour time 
| `%week`             |1-5 (week of the month) 
| `%year`             | e.g., 2011 
| `%rand`             | get a random number from 1 to 100 inclusive

Time and date information are normally local, relative to the system clock of the machine
CS is running on. See $cs_utcoffset for adjusting time based on relationship to utc (e.g
your server is in Virginia and you are in Colorado).

| `%response`        |  number of committed responses that have been generated for this sentence (see Advanced User- Advanced Output: Committed Responses 


## System variables

| variable            | description 
| --------            | ------- 
| `%all`              |  Boolean is the :all flag on? (:all to set)

## Build data

| variable   | description             
| --------   | -----------------------------------------                             
| `%dict`    | date/time the dictionary was built
| `%engine`  |  date/time the engine was compiled 
| `%os`      |  os invovled (linux windows mac ios) 
| `%script`  |  date/time build1 was compiled
| `%version` |  engine version number

You actually can assign to any of them. This will override them and make them return
what you tell them to and is a particularly BAD thing to do if this is running on a server
since it affects all users 
(unless you reset the variable at the end of the volley. 
Assigning a period to a variable resets it). 

Typically one does this as a temporary assignment in a `#!` comment line 
to set up conditions for testing using `:verify`. 

Making them return a new value is NOT the same thing as making the engine have a different value. 
Unless the variable is marked as settable, setting a value affects only the value returned by a future
call to the system variable. It does not change engine values the variable is meant to reflect.


# Control Over Input

The system can do a number of standard processing on user input, including spell
correction, proper-name merging, expanding contractions etc. This is managed by setting
the user variable `$cs_token`. 

The default one that comes with Harry is:

```
$cs_token = #DO_INTERJECTION_SPLITTING | 
            #DO_SUBSTITUTE_SYSTEM |
            #DO_NUMBER_MERGE | 
            #DO_PROPERNAME_MERGE | 
            #DO_SPELLCHECK |
            #DO_PARSE
```

The `#`signals a named constant from the `dictionarySystem.h` file. 
One can set the following:

These enable various LIVEDATA files to perform substitutions on input:

| flag                         | description 
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- 
| `#DO_ESSENTIALS`             |  perform `LIVEDATA/systemessentials` which mostly strips off trailing punctuation and sets corresponding flags instead 
| `#DO_SUBSTITUTES`            |  perform `LIVEDATA/substitutes` 
| `#DO_CONTRACTIONS`           |  perform `LIVEDATA/contractions`, expanding contractions 
| `#DO_INTERJECTIONS`          |  perform `LIVEDATA/interjections`, changing phrases to interjections
| `#DO_BRITISH`                |  perform `LIVEDATA/british`, respelling brit words to American 
| `#DO_SPELLING`               |  performs the `LIVEDATA/spelling` file (manual spell correction)
| `#DO_TEXTING`                |  performs the `LIVEDATA/texting` file (expand texting notation)
| `#DO_SUBSTITUTE_SYSTEM`      |  do all LIVEDATA file expansions
| `#DO_INTERJECTION_SPLITTING` |  break off leading interjections into own sentence
| `#$DO_NUMBER_MERGE`          |  merge multiple word numbers into one (_four and twenty_)  
| `#$DO_PROPERNAME_MERGE`      |  merge multiple proper name into one (_George Harrison_) 
| `#DO_DATE_MERGE`             |  merge month day and/or year sequences (_January 2, 1993_) 
| `#JSON_DIRECT_FROM_OOB`      |  asking the tokenizer to directly process OOB data. See `^jsonparse` in JSON manual.

The contents of the files are pairs of tokens per line.
Left is the word to replace and right is the replacement. When multiple words are
involved, the left side uses underscores to represent this and the right side uses `+`. 
If the right side is missing, it means just delete.

If any of the above items affect the input, they will be echoed as values into
`%tokenFlags` so you can detect they happened. 
The next changes do not echo into %tokenFlags and relate to grammar of input:

| flag                    | description 
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
| `DO_POSTAG`             |  allow pos-tagging (labels like ~noun ~verb become marked) 
| `DO_PARSE`              |  allow parser (labels for word roles like ~main_subject) 
| `DO_CONDITIONAL_POSTAG` |  perform pos-tagging only if all words are known. Avoids wasting time on foreign sentences in particular 
| `NO_CONDITIONAL_IDIOM`  |  will not perform substitutions in the dictionary which are considered conditional idioms 
| `NO_ERASE`              |  where a substitution would delete a word entirely as junk, don't 
| `DO_SPLIT_UNDERSCORES`  |  happens after all other input tokenization and adjustments except number merge, and separates words that have been conjoined either because the dictionary has them (_credit_card_) or because they were merged by proper name merging, or by substitution. The result is only words without underscores (excluding number words like _five_thousand_and_four_  
| `MARK_LOWER`            |  if a word is considered a proper name in CS and is marked as an upper case word, this will force it to perform any markings for its lower case form as well. Sometimes users type stuff in upper case that really should be lower  


Normally the system tries to outguess the user, who cannot be trusted to use
correct punctuation or casing or spelling. These block that:

| flag                | description 
| ----                | ------- 
| `STRICT_CASING`     |  except for 1st word of a sentence, assume user uses correct casing on words 
| `NO_INFER_QUESTION` |  the system will not try to set the QUESTIONMARK flag if the user didn't input a ? and the structure of the input looks like a question
| `DO_SPELLCHECK`     |  perform internal spell checking 
| `ONLY_LOWERCASE`    |  force all input (except "I") to be lower case, refuse to recognize uppercase forms of anything 
| `NO_IMPERATIVE`     | 
| `NO_WITHIN`         |  don't match fragments within a composite word
| `NO_SENTENCE_END`   | do not break input into sentences

Normally the tokenizer breaks apart some kinds of sentences into two. These
prevent that:

| flag               | description
| ----               | -------
| `NO_COLON_END`     |  don't break apart a sentence after a colon 
| `NO_SEMICOLON_END` |  don't break apart a sentence after a semi-colon 
| `UNTOUCHED_INPUT`  |  if set to this alone, will tokenize only on spaces, leaving everything but spacing untouched  
| `LEAVE_QUOTE`      |  if input is found within " " it will become a single token exactly as it is seen. W/o Leave_Quote, it is converted into a word without quotes and using underscores instead of spaces. So "My Fair Lady" becomes My_Fair_Lady, which would match a movie title if you had one, unlike _My Fair Lady_ becoming the resulting token and unrecognized
| `SPLIT_QUOTE`      |  if input is found within " " the quotes will be removed.

Note

you can change `$cs_token` on the fly and force input to be reanalyzed via `^retry(SENTENCE)`. 
I do this when I detect the user is trying to give his name, 
and many foreign names might be spell-corrected into something wrong and the user is
unlikely to misspell his own name. 

Just remember to reset `$cs_token` back to normal after you are done. Here is one such way, 
assuming `$stdtoken` is set to your normal tokenflags in your bot definition outputmacro:

```
#! my name is Rogr
s: (name is _*)

    if ($cs_token == $stdtoken)
        {
        $cs_token = #DO_INTERJECTION_SPLITTING |
                    #DO_SUBSTITUTE_SYSTEM | #DO_NUMBER_MERGE |
                    #DO_PARSE
        retry(SENTENCE)
        }
    _0 is the name.
    $cs_token = $stdtoken
```

If you type _my name is Rogr_ into a topic with this, the original input is spell-corrected
to _my name is Roger_, but this will change the `$cs_token` over to one without spell
correction and redo the sentence, which will now come back with _my name is Rogr_ and
be echoed correctly, and `$cs_token reset`. 

That's assuming nothing else would run differently and trap the response elsewhere. 
If you were worried about that, it would be possible for the script to save where 
it is using `^getrule(tag)` and modify your control script to return immediate control 
to here after input processing if you had changed `$cs_token`.


## Private Substitutions

While in general, substitutions are defined in the LIVEDATA folder, you can define
private substititions for your specific bot using the scripting language. You can say

    replace: xxx yyyyy

which defines a substitution just like a livedata substitution file. It actually creates a
substitution file called `private0.txt` or `private1.txt` in your TOPIC folder. 

Even then, those substitutions will not be enacted unless you explicitly add to the `$cs_token` value `#DO_PRIVATE`, eg
```
$cs_token = #DO_INTERJECTION_SPLITTING | 
            #DO_SUBSTITUTE_SYSTEM |
            #DO_NUMBER_MERGE | 
            #DO_PROPERNAME_MERGE |
            #DO_SPELLCHECK | 
            #DO_PARSE | 
            #DO_PRIVATE
```
The left side of the substitution pair is case insensitive (matches either case on input)
and can be placed in double-quotes (which converts spaces to underscores internally).

The right side of the substitution pair is case sensitive
and can be placed in double-quotes (which converts spaces to plus signs internally).

Similarly while canonical values of words can be defined in `LIVEDATA/SYSTEM/canonical.txt`, 
you can define private canonical values for your bots by using the scripting language. 
You can say:

    canon: oh 0 faster fast

which defines new canonical values for things and creates a file `canon0.txt` or `canon1.txt`
in your TOPIC folder.

If you want to set a canonical pair from a table during compilation,
you can use a function to do the same thing (but only 1 pair at a time).

    ^canon(word canonicalform)

## Numeric Substitutions

A special kind of private substitution (equally applicable in regular substitution files) is the numeric substitution.
```
replace: ?_km kilometers
```
The ?_ matches a digit number followed immediately by km, like `1.2km` and will separate the number and replace the units
with the given replacement. The input can be singular or have an 's' like `10.5dollars`. And it can be with or without abbreviation periods,
like `10kps` or `10k.p.s`

# Interchange Variables

The following variables can be defined in a script and the engine will react to their
contents.

| interchange variable | description |
| -------------------  | ------- |
| `$cs_token`          |  described extensively above| 
| `$cs_response`       |  controls automatic handling of outputs to user. By default it consists of `$cs_response = #Response_upperstart | #response_removespacebeforecomma | #response_alterunderscores | #response_removetilde` If you want none of theses, use $cs_response = 0 (all flags turned off). See ^print for explanation of flags. <br>`#response_noconvertspecial` – leave escaped n r and t alone in output and ^log, <br>`#response_upperstart` – makes the first letter of an output sentence capitalized, <br>`#Response_removespacebeforecomma` – does the obvious, <br>`#Response_alterunderscores` - converts single underscores to spaces and double underscores to singles (eg for a web url) |
| `$cs_jsontimeout`    |  seconds before JsonOpen declares a time out failure. If unspecified the default is 300 | 
| `$cs_crashmsg`       |  in server mode, what to say if the server crashes and we return a message to the user. By default the message is _Hey, sorry. I forgot what I was thinking about._ | 
| `$cs_abstract`       |  used with :abstract | 
| `$cs_looplimit`      |  loop() defaults to 1000 iterations before stopping. You can change this default with this | 
| `$cs_trace`          |  if this variable is defined, then whenever the user's volley is finished, the value of this variable is set to that of :trace and :trace is cleared to 0, but when the user is read back in, the :trace is set to this value. For a server, this means you can perform tracing on a user w/o making all user transactions dump trace data | 
| `$cs_control_pre`    |  name of topic to run in gambit mode on pre-pass, set by author. Runs before any sentences of the input volley are analyzed. Good for setting up initial values | 
| `$cs_usermessagelimit` | max number of message pairs (user input & bot output) saved in topic file | 
| `$cs_externaltag`    |  name of a topic to use to replace existing internal English pos-parser. See bottom of ChatScript PosParser manual for details | 
| `$cs_prepass`        |  name of a topic to run in responder mode on main volleys, which runs before $cs_control_main and after all of the above and pos-parsing is done. Used to amend preparation data coming from the engine. You can use it to add your own spin on input processing before going to your main control. I use it to, for example, label commands as questions, standardize sentence construction (like _if you see me what will you think_ to _assume you see me. What will you think?_) | 
| `$cs_control_main`   |  name of topic to run in responder mode on main volleys, set by author | 
| `$cs_control_post`   |  name of topic to run in gambit mode on post-pass, set by author| 
| `$botprompt`         |  message for console window to label bot output | 
| `$userprompt`        |  message for console window to label user input line| 
| `$cs_crashmsg`       |  message to use if a server crash occurs| 
| `$cs_language`       |  if spanish, will adjust spell checking for spanish colloquial| 
| `$cs_token`          |  bits controlling how the tokenizer works. By default when null, you get all bits assumed on. The possible values are in src/dictionarySystem.h (hunt for $token) and you put a # in front of them to generate that named numeric constant | 
| `$cs_abstract`       |  topic used by :abstract to display facts if you want them displayed | 
| `$cs_prepass`        |  topic used between parsing and running user control script. Useful to supplement parsing, setting the question value, and revising input idioms | 
| `$cs_wildcardseparator` |  when a match variable covers multiple words, what should separate them- by default it's a space, but underscore is handy too. Initial system character is space, creating fidelity with what was typed. Useful if _ can be recognized in input (web addresses). Changing to _ is consistent with multi-word representation and keyword recognition for concepts. CS automatically converts _ to space on output, so internal use of _ is normal |
| `$cs_userfactlimit`       | how many of the most recent permanent facts created by the script in response to user inputs are kept for each user. Std default is 100. * means all. | 
| `$cs_outputchoice`    |  for regression: forces specific one of a [] [] output choice block - base 0 | 
| `$cs_response`          |  controls some characteristics of how responses are formatted | 
| `$cs_randIndex`         |  the random seed for this volley | 
| `$cs_utcoffset`         |  if defined, then %time returns current utc time + timezone offset. The offset is usually a simple number, meaning hours, and can have + or – in front of it. It can also be a normal time reference like 02:30 which means plus 2 hours and 30 minutes beyond utc, or -01:30:20 which means 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 20 seconds before utc (as if anyone would use that). The following variables are generated by the system on behalf of scripts | 
| `$$db_error`            |  error message from a postgres failure $$findtext_start - ^findtext return the end normally, this is where it puts the start | 
| `$$tcpopen_error`       |  error message from a tcpopen error| 
| `$$document`            |  name of the document being read in document mode| 
| `$cs_randindex`         |  current value of the random generator value| 
| `$cs_bot`               |  name of the bot currently in use| 
| `$cs_login`             |  login name of the user |
| `$$csmatch_start`  |  start of found words from ^match |
| `$$csmatch_end` | end of found words from ^match |
| `$cs_fullfloat` | if defined, causes the system to generate full float 64-bit precision on outputs, otherwise you get 2 digit precision by default |
| `$cs_botid`    |  when non-zero creates facts and functions restricted by this bitmask so facts and functions created by other masks cannot be seen. allows you to separate facts and functions per bot in a multi-bot environment. During compilation if this is set by a bot: command, then functions created and facts created by tables will be restricted to that owner.| 
| `$cs_numbers` | if defined, causes the system to output numbers in a different language style: french, indian. All other values are english. |
| `$cs_topicretrylimit` | if defined changes how many times you can pass back RETRY_TOPIC before it fails (current limit is 30) |
| `$$topic_retry_limit_exceeded` | set if topic retry limit is encountered |
| `$cs_topicretrylimit` | if defined changes how many times you can pass back RETRY_TOPIC before it fails (current limit is 30) |
| `$cs_saveusedJson` | if not null, the only JSON facts CS will write into the user's topic files that are referred to (directly or indirectly) from user variables being saved. (see below) |
| `$cs_proxycredentials`    | See ^JSONOPEN in JSON manual| 
| `$cs_proxyserver`    | See ^JSONOPEN in JSON manual| 
| `$cs_proxymethod`    | See ^JSONOPEN in JSON manual| 

`$cs_saveusedJson` exists as a kind of garbage collection. Nowadays most facts will come from JSON data either from a website or created in script. But keeping
on top of deleting obsolete JSON may be overlooked. When this variable is non-null, ChatScript will automatically destroy any JSON fact that cannot trace a JSON
fact path back to some user variable. Variables that have as values the name of a JSON object or array automatically protect 
all JSON facts underneath. JSON references merely within some text string will not protect anything, nor will references from some
other non-JSON fact.
