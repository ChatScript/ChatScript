<h1 id="chatscript-practicum-messaging">ChatScript Practicum:
Messaging</h1>
<p>Copyright Bruce Wilcox, mailto:gowilcox@gmail.com
www.brilligunderstanding.com <br>Revision 6/9/2018 cs8.3</p>
<p>’‘’There’s more than one way to skin a cat’’’. A problem often has
more than one solution. This is certainly true with ChatScript. The
purpose of the Practicum series is to show you how to think about
features of ChatScript and what guidelines to follow in designing and
coding your bot.</p>
<p>Sending and receiving messages is what ChatScript and bots are all
about. One of ChatScript’s unique virtues is that it runs two
communcation channels simultaneously. One channel talks with the user.
The other talks with the application (which may be just the browser).
That second channel is referred to as “out-of-band” communication or
OOB. Messages can be sent on either or both channels.</p>
<p>ChatScript tracks the history of communcations with the user from day
1 to infinity. It is a relationship. This relationship consists of one
or more conversations. Just as when you come together with a friend,
chat for a while, and then separate. Only problem is that ChatScript
does not know when you separate, only when you come together anew. The
application is responsible for sending a null message indicating the
start of a new conversation, like when the user arrives on a
conversation page. If no null message is sent, then ChatScript will
imagine it is one long continuous conversation. The engine can compute
the passage of time since its last volley if the script wants to. But it
is perfectly reasonable that a user leaves his computer to go to the
bathroom and returns later, and it’s still the same conversation.</p>
<p>ChatScript itself is a passive server. If a message is sent to it, it
can respond (a volley). Otherwise it sits idle. It does not maintain a
connection to anyone beyond the moment of the volley so it cannot
initiate a communication. If the bot thinks it might want to initiate a
message, it has to have replied to some earlier volley with an OOB
request for a callback - it asks the application to send a new message
at some specified moment in the future. That message may be a simple
dummy message and not involve the user at all. The server cannot do
anything itself based on the passage of time - it cannot set a timer and
launch a communication. It asks the application to do that on its
behalf.</p>
<p>A volley consists of any number of “sentences” of input and any
number of sentences of output. I say “sentence” because it may not be a
traditional view of a sentence. For example, if you have turned on
interjection splitting, then</p>
<pre><code>Hi, how are you.</code></pre>
<p>becomes two sentences, splitting off the interjection. And ChatScript
limits a sentence to 254 words. So if you provide 300 words of input,
that will get split into two sentences arbitrarily at the limit.</p>
<h1 id="input-oob">Input OOB</h1>
<p>OOB input is always encased in [ ] and comes before any user input.
How you interpret the content of the [] is entirely up to your script,
but ChatScript supports some styles better than others. The content of
[] is treated as a sentence and is therefore the first sentence of the
volley. ChatScript will not attempt spell-correction or parsing, because
this is not from the user.</p>
<p>Normally your control script will test for this kind of sentence
first, and when detected, process it and move on to the next sentence
for real user behavior.</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~main_control system repeat () 

u: () $$sentenceCount += 1

#! [ emotion: annoyed pose: standing]
u: ($$sentenceCount==1 &lt; \[ * \]  ) 
    ^respond(~handle_oob) 
    ^end(SENTENCE)

.... real processing for user input ...</code></pre>
<p>The responder tests two things. First it checks that this is the
first sentence of the volley. If your application always sends OOB, then
no user can provide input that would be confused as OOB. If not, then
maybe you should provide some data in OOB that users will never stumble
onto themselves. Given that, you don’t really need to track which
sentence it is. Second, of course, the form of an OOB message is
detected. I always make a topic to handle processing oob messages and
then end the sentence because it should not be subject to responses from
the bot.</p>
<p>There are two ways of putting data in an OOB message. One is to put
whatever your script may detect. In my sample input I showed a keyword
pairs approach of data that might have been detected about the user. One
could process this OOB data like this inside the OOB topic:</p>
<pre><code>u: ( emotion: _*1)   # do something with this emotion
u: ( pose: _*1) # do something with this posture</code></pre>
<p>When your data is small and can fit in 254 words, this is simple
enough. But when you get serious amounts of data being passed in, you
need to bypass the word limit. For that, you make the content of the OOB
be, in fact, a JSON blob. In your bot macro have a line like this to
enable use:</p>
<pre><code>    $cs_token += #JSON_DIRECT_FROM_OOB </code></pre>
<p>ChatScript will detect JSON in OOB, process all the JSON during
tokenization, and return instead a single token which is the JSON id.
You should not mix these two styles.</p>
<pre><code>#! [ [ { name: entity1} { name: entity2} ]]
#! [ { name: entity1 price: $5} ]
u: (\[ _*1 \])  $$data = _0  
    # $$data holds the json entity name 
    # $$data[0].name is the first entity name if the array blob was used</code></pre>
<p>Your top level JSON can be an object or an array. ChatScript accepts
“lazy” JSON so while you can use doublequotes around field names and
string values, if your names and values don’t have special characters
like spaces in them, you can omit the quotes. The JSON entity returned
is always created as transient facts, so you need to copy out anything
you want to keep long term into permanent variables or permanent
JSON.</p>
<pre><code>u: (\[ _*1 \])  $$data = _0
    $name = $$data.name                     # individual datum 
    $jsoncopy = ^jsoncopy(PERMANENT $$data) # full blob</code></pre>
<p>Note if you make a copy, it will survive even if you set the variable
to null in the future. Facts do not need anyone pointing to them to
survive. To remove this permanent JSON, you would need to use
<code>^delete($jsoncopy)</code>. Or you could force the user to do a
reset and lose EVERYTHING about the user.</p>
<h1 id="input-user">Input User</h1>
<p>User sentences are just normal stuff that you are probably already
familiar with. You use a control script, it calls topics which in turn
have responders and gambits. But the real problems a control script has
to manage is what to do with multiple sentences from the user. What I
usually do is scan through all of the sentences first, gathering data
that I will use later. And maybe characterize why the user has all these
sentences. Are they all statements? Are they statements followed by a
terminating question? Are they a bunch of questions? What is the user
trying to do?</p>
<p>So my standard way of leafing thru all sentences involves getting a
sentence, saving it, calling a topic to analyze it that does NOT
generate a response, and then having seen all the input, restoring each
sentence and doing real output processing. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~main_control system repeat()
    ... # OOB and other stuff

# save input to retrieve later
u: GLEAN() $$sentenceCount += 1
    $_tmp = ^saveSentence($$sentenceCount) 
    ^nofail(TOPIC ^respond(~glean_data))
    if (%more) {^end(SENTENCE)}

u: OUTPUT()
    $_count = 0     
    loop($$sentenceCount)
    {
        $_count += 1
        ^restoreSentence($_count)
        ^respond(~phase2)
    }</code></pre>
<p>The GLEAN rule counts how many sentences there are, saves them, and
gleans them until there are no more sentences. The OUTPUT rule restores
each sentence and passes it off to a more normal control topic to handle
the user output determination. One assumes that the GLEAN topic will
have set various facts and variables to remember what it found so the
~phase2 topic can be guided in what it does.</p>
<h1 id="output-oob">Output OOB</h1>
<p>Output OOB follows the same style as input. You put brackets around
the output and you make it the first sentence of the output. What is
contained in the OOB is whatever agreement you have with the
application. It can be keyword pairs, JSON, or whatever.</p>
<p>The requirement that it occur first might lead you to this style of
coding to control a bot avatar…</p>
<pre><code>u: (I like meat) \[ action: smile \] I like meat, too!</code></pre>
<p>This is appropriate enough if you know you will only have one output.
But if you may have multiple outputs then things may stack up badly.
Also, it’s tedious writing this code. I prefer this style:</p>
<pre><code>outputmacro: ^action($_act)
    $$oob = ^&quot;$$oob action: $_act&quot;}
outputmacro: ^emote($_emotion)
    $$oob = ^&quot;$$oob emotion: $_emotion&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>These create and augment a transient variable with keyword pairs. Or
you could create a single macro with two arguments, your choice. Then
the script becomes</p>
<pre><code>u: (I like meat) ^action(smile) ^emote(happy) I like meat, too!</code></pre>
<p>Later you need to have a postprocessing topic like this:</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~POSTPROCESS system repeat ()
t: ($$oob)  ^postprintbefore( \[ $$oob \]) </code></pre>
<p>This will put out OOB data once, in front of all other outputs your
bot may have generated. Note that postprocess topics use gambit rules,
not responder rules, since the postprocess happens once after all
sentences have been seen, so it has not responder context.</p>
<h1 id="output-user">Output user</h1>
<p>Output to the user is whatever you want write. There are a couple of
tricky situations to consider, however.</p>
<h2 id="random-choices">Random choices</h2>
<p>First, the use of randomized choice [].</p>
<pre><code>?: (do you like meat) [Yes.] [No.] [Maybe.]</code></pre>
<p>By default rules erase themselves after use. If you have not used
KEEP on the topic or rule, then the user will only ever see this rule
firing once. Providing randomized responses is overkill. Worse, if your
script is part of a corporate bot with regression systems, randomization
will play havoc with their expected test results. You should save
randomized answers for rules that do not erase themselves AND the user
is likely to see often. Something which the user may seen once after
every long conversation is probably not going to be an issue. Like a
closing “ta ta for now” as a goodbye. It becomes more of a signature
than evidence of robotic response.</p>
<p>Note that if you reset the user, you will always get the same random
choice at first. The random value used by the system at the start of a
volley is a combination of the user’s name and what volley count it is.
Thereafter during the volley, the value fluctuates “randomly” along a
course set by that current seed. So when you reset the user, you start
the same sequence all over again if you say the same inputs. You
<code>can</code> force a different value, but really there is no reason
to usually. Users will not usually see this repeat, since they have a
continuous existence with volley count always rising. It’s only
developers who see this and repeatability is useful for testing.</p>
<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>Normally ChatScript automatically handles formatting output. You
don’t have to pay attention to whether your comma is freestanding or
attached at the end of a word. It doesn’t matter how many spaces occur
between words. Numbers can automatically have commas added (in varying
nationalities with the right controls).</p>
<p><code>$cs_response</code> is a variable that controls some output
processing by ChatScript.</p>
<pre><code>$cs_response = #OUTPUT_NOCOMMANUMBER | #ALL_RESPONSES</code></pre>
<p>The above line, in the bot macro, makes the system not automatically
add commas in numbers. It also requests standard behaviors like
uppercasing the start of a sentence, removing spaces before commands,
converting underscores to spaces, and others. You could add
<code>#OUTPUT_NOQUOTES</code> to automatically take off double quotes
from strings. Or <code>#OUTPUT_FULLFLOAT</code> to get full precision
from a float (normally CS truncates on output to 2 places). Go find
documentation on the choices.</p>
<p>But when you really want precision control in layout, then you use
active strings.</p>
<pre><code>u: (test) ^&quot;I   $verb , meat.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This active string will keep the spaces you see here when delivered
to the user.</p>
<p><code>#OUTPUT_NODEBUG</code> blocks the system from trying to
interpret words starting with : as being debug commands.</p>
<h2 id="accents">Accents</h2>
<p>Suppose you want your bot to talk with a French accent. Or use
texting. You could, of course, author your output text directly to do
this. But then you can’t readily switch to a different accent. And it
may be a pain to remember to do this on all your outputs. Another way to
do an accent is to write code that rewrites your outputs according to
the appropriate accent. This is something you can do in postprocessing.
You can have it read your outputs and rewrite them.</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~POSTPROCESSING system repeat ()
t: ()   
    $_count = 0
    Loop(%response)
    {
        $_count += 1
        $_msg = ^response($_count)
        $_newmsg = ^altermessage($_msg)
        ^setResponse($_count $_newmsg)
    }</code></pre>
<p>This loop retrieves all the outputs, calls a routine to tamper with
the content appropriately and then replaces the response with the new
response.</p>
<p>What can you do in <code>^altermessage</code>? You could hunt for
“yes” and replace it with “oui” and alter spellings to give a French
flavor. Or find words and replace them with texting equivalents.
whatever you want to do.</p>
<h2 id="self-reflection">Self Reflection</h2>
<p>The above loop sees exactly what you wrote to the user from a rule. A
message might consist of multiple sentences. If you want to see things
on a sentence by sentence basis, you can get a tokenized form of your
output. This allows you to look at each actual sentence independently.
You might, for example, record your random answers to questions so that
you can be consistent in the future. The user says “do you like meat”
and your script randomly picks from <code>Yes</code> <code>no</code> and
then you detect and record that hear so you give the same answer in the
future.</p>
<p>Something I do is automated pronoun analysis. I get the sentence, do
a full analysis on it as with any input from a user, then run a topic
designed to look for pronoun resolution data. So if my bot says “my
mother is English”, it can prepare a reference for <code>she</code> to
mean <code>my mother</code>, should the user say <code>she</code> in
their input.</p>
<pre><code>topic: POSTPROCESSING system repeat ()
t: (^query(direct_v ? chatoutput ? -1 ? @chatoutput  )) 
    $_counter = 0
    loop()
    {
        $_counter += 1
        $_utterance = ^last(@chatoutputsubject) 
        ^analyze($_utterance)
        nofail(RULE respond(~acquirepronouns)) 
    }</code></pre>
<p>ChatScript creates transient facts for the volley’s output, I
retrieve them and look at them with a script topic designed for pronoun
reference detection.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-initiative">Taking the initiative</h2>
<p>Normally ChatScript has to wait for a user to reply. But a convention
built into the browser pages for ChatScript and recommended for
developers of apps, is to support OOB callback mechanisms. This allows
your bot to initiate further messaging under various timed conditions.
The callbacks are:</p>
<pre><code>OUTPUT OOB              INPUT CALLBACK RESPONSE OOB
[callback=10000]    =&gt;   [callback]
[loopback=15000]    =&gt;   [loopback]
[alarm=400000]      =&gt;   [alarm]</code></pre>
<p>For output OOB callback, the meaning is if the user does not press a
key within the millisecond count given, issue the callback OOB message
to ChatScript. If the user is starting to respond, cancel the
callback.</p>
<p>For output OOB loopback, create an implied callback every volley,
issuing a loopback response if time runs out before the user presses a
key. If the user presses a key, suppress loopback for this volley but
keep going for future volleys.</p>
<p>For output OOB alarm, set a timer to go off in the milliseconds
indicated and when it expires send the alarm OOB to ChatScript as soon
as convenient thereafter. If user is midst of a volley, wait for that to
complete.</p>
<p>All of these timers can be canceled with a value of 0 to the
respective one.</p>
<p>This is a purely voluntary convention. Any app developer is free to
create their own conventions or ignore these.</p>
<h2 id="ex-post-facto">Ex Post Facto</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to issue message A normally, but later you have a
message B, which if it fires, wants to fire without message A having
fired. A will happen first and will not know if B will happen later.
What do you do?</p>
<p>As it turns out, with CS introspection, message B can determine that
message A happened and can cancel it. It’s quite easy. Assume we are at
message B.</p>
<pre><code>    ^nofail(RULE $_why = ^ResponseRuleID(1))
    if (^substitute(character $_why REASON xx FAIL)) {^reviseoutput(1 &quot;&quot;)}</code></pre>
<p>The above code hopes there is already a response and gets who
generated it (or $_why remains null). Then if the why was generated by
message A (here labelled REASON), then message 1 is set to null. So only
message B’s output will be seen by the user.</p>
