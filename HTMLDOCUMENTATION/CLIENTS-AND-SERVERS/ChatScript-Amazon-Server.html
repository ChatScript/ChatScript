Setting up an Amazon EC2 Server</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Copyright Bruce Wilcox, gowilcox@gmail.com <br>Revision 11/21/2021

</blockquote>
<p>If you want to make your chatbot visible on the web, you need a
server. As it turns out, for low traffic, Amazon will let you have a
server machine for free for a year and a low fee thereafter. Here is an
overview of how to create a ChatScript server on Amazon’s cloud
services.</p>
<p>First, you need an Amazon AWS account. Go to
http://aws.amazon.com/account/ and sign up for one if you don’t have
one.</p>
<p>Second, you need to acquire a server machine. You get one by going to
the AWS console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home and
clicking on the EC2 (virtual servers in the cloud) link.</p>
<p>You need to alter security for a machine you will create. By default
only you can talk to it. Locate the security tab on the left. Click the
“Create Security Group” button and name your group a name and
description. When it shows up in the list, click the name. Click on the
Inbound tab. This will allow you to change incoming port access to your
machine.</p>
<p>You want to enable HTTP if this will be a web server. Select
<code>HTTP</code> from the dropdown and then click
<code>Add Rule</code>. You’ll see the rule added to the right side of
the panel. It will use 0.0.0.0/0 as the IP addresses, which means let
anyone come into the HTTP port.</p>
<p>Click the <code>Apply Rule Changes</code> button to apply both of
these rules. If this machine is just to be a chatscript server instead
with the webpage on some other machine, you need to enable the port for
ChatScript. Select Inbound, custom TCP, select port 1024 (or whichever
you want), select ANYWHERE instead of custom. Then
<code>Save</code>.</p>
<p>You’ll need a public-private key to talk to your machine. You may
have had this generated when you created the server, else find Keypairs
and Select New Keypairs. This will prompt you for a name and then
immediately start a file download of a file with .pem. You need this
file to access your future server.</p>
<p>There is a button there that says <code>Launch Instance</code>. Click
on that. I use the quick launch wizard choice. Enter a machine label
(like My ChatScript Server) then select an Amazon Linux AMI machine
(64-bit free tier eligible). The default login id for an AMI machine is
ec2-user.</p>
<p>If you choose an Ubuntu linux, the default user is ubuntu. Once the
instance is launched, it will return you to the console where it will
show it starting up. Eventually it will be running. Nowaways the
interface to selecting your machine is different but the choices are the
same.</p>
<p>Third, you need to add stuff to the machine. There are a couple of
ways you might be using the ChatScript server. First, by itself, with a
port open to the web and talked to from your client program or webpage.
Second, from a webpage on the same machine, opening no port to users for
the ChatScript server. I chose the latter, so I had to have a webserver
installed and a webpage to talk to ChatScript. A demo webpage named
<code>index.php</code> exists in the <code>WEBINTERFACE/SIMPLE</code>
directory of chatscript and uses PHP to do the work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Wade for the initial copy of this webpage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means you need a way to communicate with it. I used WinSCP to
talk to it along with Putty, and PuttyGen to generate a key from my
keypair that WinSCP can use to authenticate itself. Let’s assume
(non-trivial) that you can get a Putty terminal talking to your
instance. You are going to need a few pieces of software on this
machine.</p>
<p>To compile CS src or even just to execute it, you will need to have
Curl installed, which for some machines is:</p>
<pre><code>sudo yum  install curl-devel</code></pre>
<p>For AMI linux do: (centos?)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>become a superuser with <code>sudo -s</code></li>
<li>get yum to update itself with <code>yum -y update</code></li>
<li>Apache (the web server stuff) comes preinstalled but you can try
<code>yum install Apache</code> and it should tell you there is nothing
to do.</li>
<li>I needed php to run my webpage, so I did yum install php`</li>
<li>If you want to be able to debug using gdb the engine itself, and
compiling with make and g++ you want to do yum groupinstall “Development
Tools”. You may have to do this anyway or use a different package to get
the std c library</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, for some machines like CentOS, to get json stuff and
evserver stuff, and you want to compile the source, you may need</p>
<pre><code>sudo yum -y install -y libc -devel gcc libc6 -compat libcurl libcurl-devel libstdc++ libgcc glibc make gcc-c++</code></pre>
<p>For Ubuntu linux:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>sudo apt-get install make</code> - to get make installed</li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get update</code> - to get current versions of
things</li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install g++</code> - to get the compiler</li>
<li>if you want postgres:
<code>sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib</code></li>
<li>if you want your web page to be here;
<code>sudo apt-get install apache2</code>and
<code>sudo apt-get install php5</code></li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install gdb</code> — for debugger for C++ if you
can use it (unlikely)</li>
</ol>
<p>Using WinSCP I created a top level folder named ChatScript and
transferred a standard ChatScript release up to the server, having first
built my bot (so the TOPICS folder was ready). I then had to make
ChatScript executable, by the following from Putty:</p>
<pre><code>cd ChatScript
chmod +x LinuxChatScript32 </code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>cd ChatScript
chmod +x LinuxChatScript64 </code></pre>
<p>(depending on your machine)</p>
<p>I also needed the webserver running, so I did
<code>service httpd start</code>. Since that starts the webserver, you
can prove that works by typing in the web name of your server (found on
the console) into a browser and getting back an Apache test page. The
server will stop if your machine ever stops, so you might want it to
automatically start up whenever the machine does.
<code>/sbin/chkconfig httpd on</code> will set autorestart on
apache.</p>
<p>You need to set the IP address in the file
<code>WEBINTERFACE/SIMPLE/index.php</code> to be the IP address of your
instance. If your webpage is on the same machine as your chatscript
server, you should use <code>localhost</code> as the ip address, meaning
the current machine. My webpage is on a different machine than my
chatscript server. In the Amazon EC2 instances display is a line
corresponding to my EC2 machine, which names both my public DNS and my
public IP. Either can be used in the script, but I use the IP since it’s
simpler. I edited the ChatScript test webpage to:</p>
<pre><code>$host = &quot;1.22.08.4&quot;; // &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; YOUR CHATSCRIPT SERVER IP ADDRESS GOES HERE</code></pre>
<p>Once you have edited that (I did it using a local editor on my laptop
and then uploaded the change along with ChatScript so I didn’t have to
use a linux editor).</p>
<p>With the file changed, I copied it to the web server page folder
via:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp WEBINTERFACE/SIMPLE/*.* /var/www/html</code></pre>
<p>Then I ran ChatScript via</p>
<pre><code>./LinuxChatScript32</code></pre>
<p>and tried to browse see my site again. And talked to my bot!</p>
<p>If it doesn’t talk, you can test to see if its the server or not that
is having the problem by using another terminal window and while in the
ChatScript directory typing</p>
<pre><code>./LinuxChatScript32 client=localhost:1024</code></pre>
<p>and try talking thru that. If that works, the server is fine and your
index.php script isn’t right for some reason.</p>
<p>Of course as soon as I leave the WinSCP connection, ChatScript comes
down. And if the machine ever restarts or ChatScript ever crashes, your
server is dead. So you need a cron job to automatically restart
ChatScript.</p>
<pre><code>crontab LINUX/jobs.cron</code></pre>
<p>will set an auto restart attempt every 5 minutes. Now I can exit my
connection to the instance and ChatScript will start up on its own and
keep going.</p>
<h3 id="better-web-page">BETTER WEB PAGE</h3>
<p>The SIMPLE webinterface just shows two lines of text. The BETTER
webinterface has a scrollable text box to see the history and supports
the loopback/callback/alarm OOB messages. You install that just like you
did the SIMPLE interface, by</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp WEBINTERFACE/BETTER/*.* /var/www/html</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Dave Morton for the improved interface. You need to edit
ui.php to set your IP address and bot name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making a Linux service Create a file called
/etc/systemd/system/chatscript.service:</p>
<p>[Unit] Description=ChatScrip service After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0 [Service] Type=simple Restart=always
RestartSec=1 User=ec2-user
ExecStart=/ec2-user/ChatScript/BINARIES/ChatScript</p>
<p>[Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target</p>
<p>systemctl start chatscript</p>
<p>And beyond that is a SPEECH WEB INTERFACE</p>
