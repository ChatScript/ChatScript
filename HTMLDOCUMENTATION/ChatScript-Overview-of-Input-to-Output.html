Input to Output</h1>
<blockquote>

<p>While there are many natural language tools and engines out there,
ChatScript is unlike most (or all) of them. Academic systems are built
of independent components that are trained on Wall Street Journal
perfect capitalization and grammar sentences. Chat isn’t that. The user
will often type in all lower case or all upper case and omit punctuation
of all sorts and use texting shortcuts. ChatScript is aimed to survive
that. While ChatScript will do pos-tagging and parsing, in general a
normal chatbot does not use that information in its rules since chat
input isn’t reliable. Instead rules will typically be based on patterns
of sets of keywords to hunt for specific meanings.</p>
<p>So how does Rose go from the input <em>is seattle in california</em>
to the output <em>No, Seattle is in Washington.</em></p>
<p>First, the incoming volley has a user associated with it, so
ChatScript loads the user’s specific state file; that tells it what
topic it was last in, when the last volley was, what’s been said, what
rules have been used up, what private facts have been generated, etc.
All of the dictionary and scripts themselves as well as world data facts
are always permanently loaded and so we are just adding a small user
veneer into the system.</p>
<p>ChatScript is going to run multiple passes of script topics on every
volley. A volley is what the user inputs (can be multiple sentences)
through to what ChatScript outputs (can be multiple sentences).</p>
<p>There is <code>$control_pre</code>, which is run before any user
sentence is analyzed. This allows you to initialize or clear your
environment variables or whatever. <code>$control_main</code> is run on
each user sentence. <code>$control_post</code> is run after all user
input has been processed, and allows you to examine all the outputs
generated to do postprocessing like generating additional emotional data
or detecting pronoun resolution information.</p>
<p>ChatScript starts by transforming input words using substitutions
files. It has files for texting, British spellings, common spelling
mistakes, contractions, abbreviations, noise (like <em>hmm</em>), and
interjections mapped as speech acts (sure = <code>~yes</code>, how are
you = <code>~howzit</code>, good night sleep tight =
<code>~emogoodbye</code>). These are all in <code>LIVEDATA</code>,
meaning they are not baked into the dictionary but loaded on startup.
Trailing punctuation is removed, with bits set to reflect punctuation
status (question, statement, exclamation).</p>
<p>Sentences beginning with an interjection/dialog-act are split off
into their own sentence, so <em>yes. I think so.</em> and <em>yes, I
think so</em> are the same two sentences. Proper names are then merged
into single tokens (the “named-entity extraction concept) so the 4
tokens <em>I love John Hardy</em> becomes 3 tokens, <em>I love
John_Hardy</em>. Similarly word numbers are merged so <em>I ate two
million and twenty four birds</em> becomes <em>I ate
two-million-twenty-four birds</em>. The sentence is then spell-checked
and revised from that if needed.</p>
<p>This smoothed input is then passed to code that generates all the
potential part of speech things each token might be (where parts of
speech include crossover roles like a noun acting like an adjective, a
verb acting as a noun, etc). At this point the input is actually split
into two streams of tokens, the original and the canonical. <em>My dogs
are fun</em> is an original stream (with pos markings) and <em>I dog be
fun</em> is a canonical stream.</p>
<p>A rule-based pos tagging pass analyzes the stream from either
viewpoint and tries to eliminate possible pos meanings, without being
wrong and eliminating a valid pos tag. This is done without trying to
understand the structure of the sentence- it is unaware of prepositional
phrases, what the main subject is, etc. The next phase runs a parser
that is aware of structural needs and combines deciding on structure
with forcing additional pos-tag restrictions as it goes. It is designed
to be a “garden path” algorithm, so it walks the words in order, looks
ahead whatever it can, and guesses what is happening. If it later
discovers an inconsistency it will try to look back and revise a
decision. But the algorithm is not interested in generating all possible
legal parses, just a most likely possible parse.</p>
<p>With the pos-tag/parse in hand, the system then decides the tense and
whether the sentence is a question even if it lacks a question mark.</p>
<p>ChatScript then marks all words in the sentence with what concepts
they belong to. <em>My dogs are fun</em> will have markings on dogs that
reflect its part of speech, its role in the sentence, the word dog,
dogs, and concepts like <code>~pets</code>, <code>~animals</code>,
<code>~beings</code>, etc. Not just individual words are marked but
series of words are marked as well, so the system can mark a movie title
or an idiomatic phrase.</p>
<p>Finally the system is ready to run script on the input. Except, the
first script it will run is not your stuff that generates output.
Instead if you have one, it will run another preparatory script to
revise its analysis. You can decide that something should be considered
a question (e.g., I treat <em>Tell me your name</em> as a kind of
question), you can revise the inputs (I treat all hypothetical sentences
like <em>if you live forever, will you die</em> as two sentences
<em>assume you live forever. Will you die</em>), you can revise inputs
substituting pronoun values for pronouns, set additional marks on idioms
(I mark <em>what do you do</em> with the <code>~work</code> topic).</p>
<p>Now finally we get to your normal main control script. Bear in mind
that all of the above analysis phase is controllable from script (you
don’t have to have spell correction). Also bear in mind that you can
redo the analysis under different constraints at any time. For example,
I have spelling correction on, but if my script detects that the user is
offering their name, I turn it off and tell input to reanalyze. The odds
of them spelling their name wrong are low and the odds they have an
unusual name are high, so an input like <em>My name is Haro Varis</em>
will be managed by changing the conditions of analysis after the
fact.</p>
<p>The control script will directly invoke some topics unrelated to the
content of the sentence. Other topics will get called because there are
words in the sentence that have appropriate keywords for the topic. In
the case of “is seattle in califoria”, the markings of
<code>~city</code> on Seattle and <code>~state</code> on California will
route it to my geography topic. Where a pattern like:</p>
<pre><code>?: ( &lt;&lt; is _~city in _~state &gt;&gt; ^query(direct_sv _0 part ? 1 ))</code></pre>
<p>will catch it. Note the <code>^query</code> call. It could be inside
the pattern or outside at the start of the output. Makes no difference
really. It goes and looks up geography facts that ship with ChatScript
to see if any such facts exist. Such a table fact is:</p>
<pre><code>(Seattle part Washington)</code></pre>
<p>Nothing says the fact is the one we want, merely that we know data
about Seattle’s relationship to the world. Had the question been <em>is
seattle in europe</em> we’d still be looking at the same fact, which
while not useful for the question yet, tells us we know the relationship
of Seattle in the world. The actual output script will have to determine
what fact is really needed, by chasing around the facts relationships.
Eventually it will determine if Seattle is in the named state or
continent or planet or solar system or whatever, and make its planned
response.</p>
<p>Grist for the mill of scripts is the fact that ChatScript supports
introspection. You can see into its workings. You can find out what
kinds of input substitutions were performed. You can change marks and
tense and punctuation on the fly or analyze an arbitrary sentence. You
can alter the availability of rules and topics, you can retrieve rule
data itself, which means you can write scripts to replace how
ChatScript’s various routines normally handle things. For example, I
have my own <code>^rejoinder()</code> handler to allow the system to
manage yes/no inputs which have follow ups. This allows the system to
see that <em>yes I love chicken</em> can be handled by ignoring the yes
handler and moving directly to I love chicken under appropriate
circumstances, while <em>yes. Do you go to football games</em> will
probably be accepting the yes rejoinder branch and treating the next
input as unrelated. The postprocessing topic is all about introspection-
seeing what the chatbot generated for output, what rules and topic it
came from, etc.</p>
<p>With output generated, the system returns to any next input sentence.
When all sentences are handled, the system invokes the post processing
script. Then it outputs whatever it has to the user, writes out the
user’s status file and resets itself back to a clean state, ready for
new input from an arbitrary new user.</p>
