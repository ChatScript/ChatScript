<h1 id="chatscript-multiple-bots-manual">ChatScript Multiple Bots
Manual</h1>
<p>Copyright Bruce Wilcox, mailto:gowilcox@gmail.com
www.brilligunderstanding.com <br>Revision 6/13/2022 cs13.2</p>
<p>The system can support multiple bots cohabiting the same engine. You
can restrict topics to be available only to certain bots. You can also
restrict facts and functions, such that variants exist per bot.</p>
<h1 id="restriction-by-rule">Restriction by Rule</h1>
<p>The simplest thing is to restrict rules to being available only to
certain bots by using something like</p>
<pre><code>?: (%bot=harry ...)

?: (%bot!=harry ...).

t: (%bot=harry) My name is harry.</code></pre>
<p>You specify which bot you want when you login, by appending
<code>:botname</code> to your login name, e.g.,
<code>bruce:harry</code>. The demo system has only one bot, Harry. If it
had two bots in it,Harry and Georgia, you could get Georgia by logging
in as <code>yourname:georgia</code>. And you can confirm who she is by
asking <code>what is your name</code>.</p>
<p>When you don’t give a botname, you get the default bot. How does the
system know what that is? It looks for a fact in the database whose
subject will be the default bot name and whose verb is defaultbot. If
none is found, the default bot is called anonymous, and probably nothing
works at all. Defining the default bot is what a table does when you
compile <code>simplecontrol.top</code>. It has:</p>
<pre><code>table: ^defaultbot (^name)
^createfact(^name defaultbot defaultbot)
DATA:
harry</code></pre>
<p>Typically when you build a level 1 topic base (e.g.,
<code>:build ben</code> or <code>:build 1</code> or whatever), that
layer has the initialization function
(<code>bot definition script</code>) for your bot(s) otherwise your bot
cannot work.</p>
<p>This function is invoked when a new user tries to speak to the bot
and tells things like what topic to start the bot in and what code
processes the users input. You need one of these functions for each bot,
though the functions might be pure duplicates (or might not be). In the
case of Harry, the function is</p>
<pre><code>^outputmacro: harry()
    ^addtopic(~introductions)
    $cs_control_pre = ~control
    $cs_control_main = ~control
    $cs_control_post = ~control</code></pre>
<p>You can change default bots merely by requesting different build
files that name the default, or by editing your table.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-bots">MULTIPLE BOTS</h2>
<p>To have multiple bots available, one might start by making multiple
folder copies of Harry and changing them to separate bots with separate
<code>filesxxx.txt</code>. That’s fine for building them as each
stand-alone bots, but if you want them to cohabit you must have a single
<code>filesxxx.txt</code> file that names the separate bot’s folders-
they must be built together.</p>
<p>If all you do is create multiple <code>bot definition scripts</code>,
then the bots all equally share all outputmacro definitions, all topics,
and all facts created at build time. However, facts created during
conversation with a user will all be unique. A conversation between a
specific bot and user results in a separate USERS topic file, so what
one bot learns the others do not.</p>
<p>If you try to create two bots by having separate folders for each,
and merely clone copies of an original folder, like
<code>~control</code> and <code>~introductions</code> and
<code>~childhood</code> and you will get an error message when
compiling. Likely you would want only one copy of <code>~control</code>
that both bots used. And either they should have different topic names
for <code>~introductions</code> and <code>~childhood</code> OR you must
put a bot restriction on things. See below</p>
<p>You can name multiple bots separated by commas with no extra spaces.
E.g. <code>topic: ~mytopic bot=harry,roman [mykeyword]</code></p>
<h2 id="restriction-by-topic">Restriction by Topic</h2>
<p>A topic can be restricted to specific bots. You do this at topic
definition time by naming the one or more bots (separated by commas but
no spaces) allowed to use the topic.</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~mytopic bot=Harry,Georgia REPEAT (keyword)</code></pre>
<p>Now you learn that you can create multiple copies of the same topic,
so different bots can have different copies. These form a topic family
with the same name. The rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the topics share the union of keywords</li>
<li><code>:verify</code> can only verify the first copy of a topic it is
allowed access to</li>
</ul>
<p>You may create multiple copies of a topic name, which vary in their
bot restrictions and content. The set of keywords given for a topic is
the union of the keywords of all copies of that topic name. You should
not name a topic ending in a period and a number (that is used
internally to represent multiple topics of the same name).</p>
<p>When the system is trying to access a topic, it will check the bot
restrictions. If a topic fails, it will try the next duplicate in
succession until it finds a copy that the bot is allowed to use.</p>
<p>This means if topic 1 is restricted to Ben and topic2 is
unrestricted, Ben will use topic 1 and all other bots will use topic2.
If the order of declaration is flipped, then all bots including Ben will
use topic 2 (which now precedes topic 1 in declaration).</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>:disable</code> and <code>:enable</code>
commands to turn off all or some topics for a personality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you don’t have to use a bot restriction per topic. You
can put one in a file and all topics compiled thereafter inherit that
(but it is overridden if a topic has a specific value).</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~topic1 ()
...
bot: Ben
topic: ~topic2 ()   This topic is restricted to Ben
...</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, you don’t have to do it per file. You can do it in the
filesxxx.txt build file. But you need to compile any bot definitions
without a bot restriction in effect. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>RAWDATA/BOTDEFINTIONS
bot: Harry
RAWDATA/HARRY/
bot: Georgia    
RAWDATA/HARRY/  
bot: 0
RAWDATA/QUIBBLE/</code></pre>
<p>Note how we have reused all topics from Harry unchanged. That was
pointless. But you could have cloned the HARRY folder for Georgia and
then made modifications and then compiled that. The duplicate topics can
coexist. The <code>bot: 0</code> turns off bot restrictions.</p>
<p>If you have bot restrictions within a file, they temporarily win over
the build file one, which resumes effect when the file or topic
ends.</p>
<h2 id="shared-facts">Shared Facts</h2>
<p><code>Share</code> - Normally, if you have multiple bots, they all
talk independently to the user. What one learns or says is not available
to the other bots. It is possible to create a collection of bots that
all can hear what has been said and share information. Share on a topic
means that all bots will have common access/modification of a topic’s
state. So if one bot uses up a gambit, the other bots will not try to
use that gambit themselves.</p>
<pre><code>topic: ~mytopic SHARE REPEAT ()</code></pre>
<p>All facts created will be visible to all bots. And if you create a
permanent user variable with the starting name <code>$share_</code>,
then all bots can see and modify it. So <code>$share_name</code> becomes
a common variable. When sharing is in effect, the state with the user
(what he said, what bot said, what turn of the volley this is, where the
rejoinder mark is) is all common among the bots- they are advancing a
joint conversation.</p>
<h2
id="fully-independent-bots---restriction-of-facts-and-functions">Fully
Independent Bots - Restriction of Facts and Functions</h2>
<p>Normally all facts generated during compilation are available to all
bots. But you can create facts restricted to specific bots. You can have
up to 64 different bots controlling different facts. You do this by
setting <span class="math inline">$cs_botid to a value prior to creating
facts. And you put `$</span>cs_botid =
some_number<code>in your bot definition script. The numbers form a bit mask that authorizes ownership and access to facts. For example in the bot definition script for Harry you might do</code><span
class="math inline">$cs_botid = 1` and for Georgia you do
`$</span>cs_botid = 2`. Each value represents a bit and should therefore
be a power of 2.</p>
<p>When you want to create facts in tables, somewhere at the start of
one bot’s facts to be created, you can<br />
set the <code>$cs_botid</code> from a table. More convenient is to use
the <code>bot:</code> command to do it in either a file or a build
area.</p>
<pre><code>bot: 1 Harry</code></pre>
<p>When you use a bot: command as a line in your
<code>filesxxx.txt</code> build file, it sticks forever until some other
bot: command is hit. If that is a local file command, then that affects
the file but then the compile reverbs to no bot: value until the next
one is hit (either globally or in a file).</p>
<p>This sets both the botid and the bot name, which controls what
restrictions facts get (botid) and what restrictions topics get (bot
name). The botid goes beyond controlling facts. It also controls
ownership of outputmacro definitions. You can define different copies of
functions with the same name, different arguments, different code, by
making the botid be different.</p>
<p>You can change to a bot owner without naming any bots, in which case
topics created will be usuable by any bot but facts and functions will
be restricted by bot owner.</p>
<pre><code>bot: 2</code></pre>
<p>You disable ownership rules with</p>
<pre><code>bot: 0</code></pre>
<p>In the build file, you need to compile all bot definition macros and
the default bot macro under bot: 0 ownership. All other bots can be
built independently by using bot ids that are powers of two and unique
bot names. ``` bot: 0 private/Mine/CONTROL/botmacro.top
private/Mine1/CONTROL/botmacro.top private/Mine2/CONTROL/botmacro.top
bot: 1 John private/John/ bot: 2 Harry private/Harry/ bot: 4 Martha
private/Martha/</p>
<h1 id="changing-bot-id-on-the-fly">Changing bot id on the fly</h1>
<p>^changebot(botname botid) allows a bot to pretend to be another bot
and access its data, functions, and topics. Variables are not affected
by this. The user topic file will remain as the user came into the
server.</p>
