<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<h2 id="natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</h2>
<p>NLP is the subdomain of artificial intelligence concerned with the
“word”, ranging from voice input through to speech output.</p>
<p>All of it is deeply hard research stuff and the core is a focus on
text words, ranging from sentences to paragraphs to documents. The
analysis of the word ranges from determining frequencies of word use and
collocations of words (e.g., for document content classification,
document similarity comparison, and sentiment analysis) to pattern
matching, word stemming, and part-of-speech tagging and parsing (for
trying to access part of the meaning of text for information retrieval
systems, machine summarization, machine translation, and natural
language command and control over programs and devices). Keyword search
(e.g., Google or Amazon) is a simplified use of NLP which does not
involve meaning to find information or products.</p>
<p>Given its historical research component, it has been primarily
developed by academics for academics. Major NLP tools have been written
in LISP, Java, C++, Python, and Perl and run on either Windows or Linux
(Mac is a Linux) or both. There are rarely any performance requirements
in cpu time or memory and they don’t run on mobile devices. The only
area of NLP that actually has real-time requirements and are primarily
engineered by the business world are chatbots, which either answer
questions (e.g. Siri) or converse on either their own life story
(entertainment) or on corporate information (customer help agents). They
need to reply within seconds of the user’s input.</p>
<h2 id="video-game-overview">Video Game Overview</h2>
<p>Video games are a completely unrelated industry. The traditional AAA
game takes several years to develop using a team of 40 people and costs
millions to make. Game development has to manage a production pipeline
for gazillions of animation and sound assets and deliver them to the
screen at a minimum of 30 frames per second (33 milliseconds per
frame).</p>
<p>Cpu performance and memory use are always of paramount importance. So
are testing and bug reproducability, since millions of customers will be
outraged if they play a game for hours and then it freezes or crashes on
them. Given those requirements, game engines are not programmed in
whatever language pleases the developers. They are programed in C++ for
maximum performance.</p>
<p>And game levels are written by less skilled programmers called
designers, who write in scripting languages. These are less complete
programming languages built on top of the engine, which focus on the
common elements needed for writing games. Scripting languages let you
write less to achieve more.</p>
<h2 id="chatscript">ChatScript</h2>
<p>So how do these two industries intersect? They intersect in
ChatScript because I come to the NLP industry from the videogame
industry. I started out in NLP on the chatbot side, where issues of
content authoring and real-time performance abound. I have applied all
of the concerns and characteristics of the video game industry to
creating an engine that can perform in real time and perform on mobile
devices.</p>
<p>You probably think of ChatScript as a system just for writing
chatbots - for conducting some kind of prescripted conversation. This
view is incomplete. ChatScript is also a broad industrial-strength
system for a wide range of English NLP tasks. ChatScript is radically
different from other NLP tools because it was architected with many
considerations in mind: compact authoring expressiveness, speed, size,
capability, and maintainability.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-opinions-of-chatscript">Real World Opinions of
ChatScript</h2>
<p>I know a guy who has worked for over a decade with different
commerical customer help agent software systems for business and
education, which are a kind of chatbot. He was tired of the industry and
was exiting it when ChatScript arrived. Now he has switched over to
ChatScript and is reinvigorated. Its performance and capabilities exceed
all the systems he is familiar with and he knows all the major
players.</p>
<p>The Virtual Patient project at OSU used AIML chatbot technology. They
were dying because they had hundreds of thousands of rules that were
killing their server’s performance and were unmaintainable. Every new
rule added tended to break something elsewhere. They switched over to
ChatScript and rewrote their system. It takes less than 2,000 rules and
they figure their final system will not exceed 5000. Adding new rules
without breaking things is easy and the system automatically tells them
when they do create conflicts. Their server has no load at all and can
run multiple different patient simulations simultaneously.</p>
<p>An example of a high-quality ChatScript bot, Tom Loves Angela that
took about 5 person-months to create 16,000 script lines for iOS/Android
. It stayed in the top 10 of Apple’s AppStore paid Entertainment
category for 6 months. It was still in the top 25 iPad apps 18 months
after release, even though the extension to 26,000 lines of Talking
Angela was also released.</p>
<h2 id="the-holy-grail---meaning">The Holy Grail - Meaning</h2>
<p>Understanding meaning is the holy grail of NLP. If you’ve ever used
Google translate on a Japanese website, you’ll know that even Google
doesn’t understand meaning. Most tools have to settle for focusing on
words without any meaning. Parser tools get closest, but only when they
can successfully parse the sentence.</p>
<p>While no software can understand the meaning of what people may
unexpectedly say, ChatScript - better than any other software in the
world - allows you to hunt in the input for a particular meaning,
whether the input is parseable or not . For example, if you said <em>I
love dogs except on days of the week starting with a letter</em>
ChatScript would not understand that you don’t like dogs (unless we had
explicitly written script to hunt for that meaning). But we could write
a single brief rule in a pets topic which hunts for the meaning that you
own an animal. The user could say I own two poodles or i have a dog or
my parrot eats seeds and the system could record what kind of animal you
owned and react to it with appropriate chat. And it would not be
confused by <em>I don’t own a cat or I would never have a dog</em> or
<em>I have no pet but my friend owns a dog</em>.</p>
<h1 id="chatscript-architecture-objectives">ChatScript Architecture
Objectives</h1>
<h2 id="compact-authoring">Compact authoring</h2>
<p>Because everything is scripted, it means every chatbot is all
hand-authored. One could not create a major chatbot automatically. It’s
a consistent skilled creation. The more script you have to type, the
longer it takes to code. ChatScript is both extremely clear and
extremely concise. Our chatbots of 12K to 16K ChatScript rules
outperform chatbots with hundreds of thousands of their rules. They take
years to write theirs; we take months.</p>
<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>A low-grade server running our most advanced chatbot can generate a
response in a few milliseconds; handling thousands of simultaneous users
at once. And you can run ChatScript on each core of a machine
simultaneously, servering the same port, with near linear scaling, so an
8-core machine can handle well over 10K simultaneous conversations.</p>
<p>As for parsing English sentences, Stanford’s parser is the gold
standard for such things. But it runs over much slower than we do.
Stanford’s online server parses at a rate of 28 tokens per second
(periods and commas are also tokens). Parsing a serious document would
take it a long time. On my basic laptop, ChatScript can scan and parse a
document at 30,000 tokens per second. We parse user input and chatbot
output as part of the several milliseconds response time merely to
automatically handle pronoun resolution for chat.</p>
<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
<p>Our largest chatbot with Chatscript, parsing, etc, runs on an iPhone
in 18Mb of memory. It doesn’t matter whether the input sentence is 5
words or 250 words. For Stanford’s parser, you can’t fit it on a phone.
20 word sentences take 50MB. 50 word sentences take 125MB. And their FAQ
says “We have parsed sentences as long as 234 words, but you need lots
of RAM and patience.”</p>
<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>
<p>Because ChatScript is concise, maintaining tens of thousands of rules
is tons easier than maintaining hundreds of thousands (which is what
other bots have to do). But ChatScript builds in explicit mechanisms to
support maintenance. First, you can author things by topics, which are
independent of each other and provide logical structured areas for rules
on areas of knowledge. This makes it easy for multiple authors to work
on a bot simultaneously.</p>
<p>Second, with every rule you associate a sample input- something the
user might say that is supposed to trigger that rule. ChatScript can
automatically test that the rule would respond to that input and that no
other rule anywhere else in the system would collide and try to take
control instead. It can generate reports that tell you of problems with
your rules. Third, you can hold an ideal conversation with the system
and ask it to turn that into a regression test.</p>
<p>You can then run that test anytime in the future to see if the system
has degraded. Even if you insert other rules or alter the code of a
rule, it can usually tell you whether you are still executing correctly
even though the literal output has changed.</p>
<p>Fourth, ChatScript has analytic tools to peruse user logs. It can
find user inputs that mention a particular word or words, tell you how
many users entered a topic, how often, how deep they got into it, how
many times a rule was executed and what users said just before or just
after that are likely related to it. You can use these tools to find
popular topics to expand, extend reactions to user inputs, and learn
what things a topic fails to cover that seem to be frequent with
users.</p>
<p>ChatScript can also print out abstracts of the system (what a user
might say and what the system would say in return) so that customers can
bless or request adjustment of the content without them having to know
any ChatScript syntax or having to try out random inputs by themselves
(they would never be able to test it all). And it can spell check the
outputs. Or if you specify an age level, it can tell you where in the
output you wrote there are words that violate vocabulary guidelines for
that age group.</p>
<p>ChatScript can also trace execution of the script to controllable
levels of detail when you are trying to debug why your script failed.
You can trace a kind of activity (like function calls), a topic, etc</p>
<h1 id="chatscript-capabilities">ChatScript Capabilities</h1>
<p>Finally, it’s all about what ChatScript can do easily and what you
can do with ChatScript.</p>
<h2 id="conversation">Conversation</h2>
<p>First thing that comes to mind is controlling conversation.
ChatScript is good at finding the rule you wrote to address a specific
meaning, so it can appropriately answer users’ questions. It is also
good at conversational management, taking charge in a topic and leading
the user on a conversational journey in a subject. Or taking
conversational requests to speak on a subject or drop some subject.</p>
<h2 id="emotion">Emotion</h2>
<p>ChatScript can classify expressed and implied emotions in user input
and react accordingly. We have written bots that get huffy when
insulted, respond with put-downs for sexual innuendos, detect when you
seem bored with the discussion (based on expressed input or imputed
behavior like how long your responses are) and either change topic or
directly ask you if you are bored. You can use ChatScript to control
gestures of an avatar to express bot emotions simultaneous with verbal
output.</p>
<h2 id="user-tracking">User Tracking</h2>
<p>ChatScript keeps track of conversations with each user; can record
where it is in a conversational flow and what facts it has learned about
a user (you have to tell it what facts to try to learn). You can
optionally keep logs of the conversations (either on a ChatScript server
or locally on a freestanding device).</p>
<h2 id="multiple-bots">Multiple Bots</h2>
<p>ChatScript can support multiple chatbots at the same time, either all
acting independently or all coordinating in something like a theatrical
production where multiple bots chat with each other and with the user.
If you asked one chatbot a question about his family you’d get one
answer, and if you asked a different one the same question you’d get a
different answer. And if you asked one a fact question about some topic
the other knows, usually the other would answer it instead.</p>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>Apart from mere conversation and avatar gesture control, you can
write scripts of how to do things and ChatScript has built-in planner
code that can combine them to achieve a goal. You could ask your robot
for a ham sandwich and it could decide on a plan to go into the kitchen
and make one, including going thru closed or open doors, returning for
the key if the door is locked.</p>
<h2 id="big-data-access">Big Data Access</h2>
<p>ChatScript can interact with the open source Postgres database. We
can store gigabytes of information and access it quickly using NLP. One
person used ChatScript to query a Dun &amp; BradStreet database. We are
working on using it to store digested wikipedia information so we can
query it instantly.</p>
<h2 id="document-reading">Document reading</h2>
<p>ChatScript has a built in pos-tagger/parser. It can be used to read a
document and try to extract information from it. There is even a
wikipedia to plain text converter in ChatScript, so you can datamine
Wikipedia with appropriate script. We are hoping to make the document
reader automatically preliminarily grade papers in massive on-line
courses.</p>
<p>Unlike normal NLP tools which are all trained on proper Wall Street
Journal input (proper casing, proper speech), ChatScript aims to handle
text which is not grammatically correct and which may be in all lower
case or all upper case.</p>
<p>These capabilities support a more reliable sentiment analysis.This is
just another area of hunting for meaning. Most sentiment analysis merely
tallies keywords to decide positive or negative. So <em>it’s not a good
movie</em> is likely to be considered positive.</p>
<p>A bunch of literature talks about using sentence analysis (parsing)
to improve sentiment, being able to take into account the not for
example. Or a sentence like <em>I liked it in spite of its horrible
acting, bad pacing, and stupid plot</em>. But there are several issues
here. First, something like the Stanford parser is slow. Second, it is
hard to work with its output parse tree. Third, being based on
statistical probability, it has no clue if it’s parse is correct or not.
While it’s partof-speech tagging of words is 97.3% accurate, its parse
is wrong almost half the time.</p>
<p>ChatScript’s parser is fast, integrated with ChatScript for easy use,
and can generally know if it has found a parse or not because it is
based on grammar rules. So if it can’t parse something, it can know that
and fall back on its more general pattern matching abilities.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity-to-other-data">Connectivity to other data</h2>
<p>ChatScript can interact with the local machine (e.g. robotics
control) or the Internet. You can from script request arbitrary programs
be run locally and process returned data. Similarly you can use HTTP to
request information (current temperature in Singapore, what is the size
of the moon) or whatever via the Internet, postprocessing the HTML you
get back to pull out the answers.</p>
<h2 id="improved-search">Improved Search</h2>
<p>ChatScript supports defining and manipulating pattern matches on
collections of words. This is part of how rules can be so concise. But
it also means it can pull apart information in unusual ways.</p>
<p>We can outperform Amazon search. A typical Amazon product keyword
search from a user is a series of words. To Amazon the words have no
inherent order, but to the user they do, because they represent a
meaning of what they want. If the user says <em>teal kitchen timer made
of aluminum not made in China, costing around $50</em>, we can decompose
that into all the intents the user expressed (including that teal is a
hue of the color blue). Amazon search can’t handle that.</p>
<p>It can’t even handle <em>teal kitchen timer</em>. Only the 10th of
the ten items found by them is in fact a timer. Since it recognizes it
found way too few items, it also displays searches trying to reduce your
input. So you see three items from teal kitchen none of which are
timers. Then it gives you three items from kitchen timer, which are in
fact kitchen timers though none of them are teal or even blue. Then it
gives you three items from teal timer, but none of them are kitchen
timers.</p>
<p>We wrote a program that took the first page of Amazon search results
and reordered the items based on how closely they matched what the user
wanted. So we would put that timer first in the list. And when Amazon
returns too few matching items, we could tell it to re-search using
<em>blue kitchen timer</em>, and if that was no good we could have then
done <em>kitchen timer</em>. We can even handle context-sensitive
distinctions like <em>chocolate pecans</em> (meaning chocolate flavor)
vs <em>chocolate shirt</em> (meaning chocolate color).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>ChatScript is an ever evolving system, gaining new capabilities every
month. You could think of ChatScript as being like the Siri engine on
steroids. With enough scripting, one could create a Siri that really
could help you with every aspect of your online life. Eventually
ChatScript, because is faster, more capable, and takes less memory, will
overtake all existing NLP tools and become the world’s NLP standard.</p>
