Renamed DOCUMENTATION to PDFDOCUMENTATION

Version 6.8 8-13-2016
1. JsonParse allows optional argument before the data of NOFAIL - will return null without error if something is wrong
2. ^jsonpath can end a path with *, which means return fact id rather than object of fact. EG
	^jsonpath(.value* $$id)  or ^jsonpath(".foo[5]*" $$id)

Version 6.62   7-24-2016
WARNING- USER TOPIC FILE FORMAT CHANGED, old ones will self destruct and clear to empty

4. $cs_externaltag ^setoriginal, ^setcanon, ^settag, ^setrole

Version 6.61 7-17-2016
1. jsonobjectinsert will delete old value if exists, then insert replacement.
2. ^jsonarraysize is now deprecated in favor of ^length - you get nonfatal warning messages
3. ^jsondelete is now deprectated in favor of  ^delete - you get nonfatal warning messages

Version 6.6  7-4-2016

3: :restart now accepts up to 4 commandline parameters
4. ^savesentence(label) and ^restoresentence(label) will save and restore an entire
   sentence preparation, so you can jump back and forth between sentences in pattern matching w/o real cost.


Version 6.5a 5-18-2016
1. ChatScript now enforces a rule that a function variable name should not be the name of an existing function (hides the function).
This may cause your builds to break until you rename your variables in question.
2. :trace full -- when set, disables NOTRACE() so everything is traced using all flags
   :trace ignorenotrace just turns on the flag, leaving your other bits intact
   :trace none turns off all bits and any ignorenotrace flag
3. PRIVATE_CODE now requires PrivateInit() and PrivateRestart() and PrivateShutdown() functions and
file privatetestingtable.cpp  for any :test overrides, a command line paramemter private= passes its value
thru to PrivateInit
4. ResponseRuleID(-1) does all to date

version 6.5 -- 5-7-2016  WARNING- change of directory structure in TOPIC
0. TOPIC now gets subdirectories for each of the build layers. While it will work with content in the old format (all at top level)
or the new format (subdivided into BUILD0 and BUILD1 subdirectories, it will only :build into the new format. If you have
deployment scripts, make sure when they perform builds that CS can create these subdirectories.

1. when using pattern-  u: ($$test?)  which would see if word was found in sentence,
if it is a quoted string "buy me" it will be able to find that sequence as matching.
2. ^jsonarraydelete([INDEX,VALUE] array index) to remove element and renumber later ones down
3.  while !not in pattern checks that not doesnt appear later in the sentence, !!not checks that it is not the next word
4.  :trace RULEFLOW will just show the rules as it does their outputs. It is a terse flow of control view.

version 6.4  4/30/2016
1. ^importfacts may have null as its set value. It wont store the facts created in a factset.
2. ^conceptlist takes optional 3rd arg, prefix to filter by
3. ^words(word) get all dictionary entries with this spelling, upper and lower case, spaces vs underscores
4. #define DISCARDDATABASE renamed to DISCARDPOSTGRES
5. ^dbinit(EXISTS ...) will return normally when db is already open
6. :restart autocloses a postgres db
7. ^CSBOOT will now print its results to console and if a server, to server log
8. ^CSSHUTDOWN added for system going down behaviors


version 6.3a 4/16/2016
1. jsonarrayinsert allows a leading flag UNIQUE, in which case it does not add to array if already there.
2. ^notrace(... ) turns off regular tracing for the given stream. Explicit function and topic traces are not blocked, just normal :trace xxdx
3. $cs_jsontimeout  sets json wait delay (300 second default)
4. save/restore local variables allow you to avoid naming collisions -- see advanced manual outputmacros:
e.g. outputmacro: ^myfunc(^arg1) ($$tmp $$tmp1)
	code
 the values of $$tmp and $$tmp1 are saved and restored across the call, so the macro may safely write on them.
5. ^return(...)   see advanced manual outputmacros:


version 6.3 4/10/2016
1. ~twitter_name detected as concept for @xxx names  and ~hashtag_label detected as concept
2. $cs_beforereset and $cs_afterreset if, assigned to functions, will execute them before and
after a :reset. This is your chance to pass some information across to the newly reinited user.
I store data in _match variables before and retrieve them after.
3. Outputmacros can be declared as executable javascript code. New manual in Esoterica for that.

version 6.2g 3/27/2016
1. fixed slowdown introduced into the engine a few versions ago.

version 6.2f  3/25/2016
1. ^jsonparse now accepts a flag argument of SAFE, which means you can use it against data the extends beyond the minimal, meaning
if you memorize OOB data after [, you dont have to care to find the closing ], which will be hard since JSON itself has ] in it. Eg
	u: ( \[ _* ) $$jsonfacts ^jsonparse(safe _0)
2. support for spanish spellchecking

version 6.2e 3/20/2016

version 6.2d 3/14/2016
1. ^substitute 1st arg can now be "insensitive", meaning character search and case insensivive. Or you can
provide a string like "word insensitive" to pass 2 arguments.
2. %originalSentence will give you the raw user input for the current sentence (after tokenization)
3. ^original(_0) will give you the original text of the user that this match derives from (see docs for more details)


version 6.2c  3/5/2016
1. You no longer have to backslash [ in an active string. You can do ^"[$count]" with impunity.
   That means that using [] [] notation to designate a choice of text is no longer effective inside
   an active string"
2.  ^Next(loop) will skip the rest of code in a loop and begin the next interation (NO MATTER how far
   up the call chain the loop actually is)
3. CS can now be run old-style (all executables at top level) or within BINARIES
4. %host gives you the name of the currently running host.
5. ^pos(verb be present/past XXX) optional 4th arg to verb form, names pronoun or noun used, so better handles irregular verbs
6. $cs_language, if set to spanish, alters spellchecking for spanish

version 6.2b  2/24/2016
1. Moved executables and DLLS to folder BINARIES. You must now run CS from there rather than top level.
   CS changes current working directory up 1 level after starting.
   Revise Cron jobs and shortcuts to the exe appropriately.

version 6.2a  2/20/2016
1. ^norejoinder()  makes this rule unable to set its rejoinder. 
2. CS now allows multiple forms of uppercase words, e.g.,  ID and Id 
3. Recently a major security hole in glibc, open source c library was announced and patched. CS uses glibc.
   This build uses the new version. If you are running older versions of CS, there is some security risk and
   you are advised to upgrade to this executable linux version, or apply sudo yum update to glibc (or equivalent
   commands) and then rebuild your existing sources.
4. optional 3rd argument to ^jsonpath(xx yy safe) tells it to return ugly data with doublequotes around it. Things with
   embedded json data or whitespace need to be passed into jsonformat using safe data.



version 6.2 2/14/2016
1. documented existing assignment abilities:  @3 = @2  @3 -= @2  @3 += @2  @3 = $$factid
  @3 += $$factid  @3 -= $$factid
2. new command line parameter timer=15000x10 to control how long a volley can last before being abandoned
by time. 1st number is millisecond limit, 2nd is a checking frequency (reducing load of getting the time
frequently)
3. %maxmatchvariables and %maxfactsets  given the highest legal number for those respective things
4. UNLIKELY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:  previously if you used match variables inside a nested pattern component, e.g.,
	u: ( _this ( my _*1 ) )
it would be discarded on return to the top level. THEREFORE except in unusual cases, you would not have nested match
requests.  NOW... they are not discarded. If the above matches, _0 and _1 are both defined. Same for
	u: (this _(my _{often} dog))
which sets 3 match variables

version 6.1d 2/7/2016
1. new command line parameter debug=   allows you to execute a :debug command on bootup and then exit.
eg. "debug=:trim USERS 4"
2. IF tests can now be made of a std rule pattern (including memorization etc) using form
if (pattern ....)   {}  which means you can match input and even memorize during the if test


Version 6.1c  2/2/2016
1. ^sequence added, similar to refine, except instead of only executing one rule, executes all matching rules.
2. Added :common word1 word2 to tell you the concepts they both particpate in, closest first.

to minimize CS memory use. See end of Finalizing a bot: Mobile size issues

Version 6.01 1-7-2016
1. easier to follow output tracing
2. jsonopen now supports PUT as a type (with arguments just like POST)
3. ^length now accepts the name of a json object or array, and returns the number of elements it has

Version 6.0 1-02-2016
1. easier to understand pattern tracing
2. ^print accepts more flags (RESPONSE_ ) controlling output
3. %timenumbers for a complete second minute hour dayinweek dateinmonth  month year data

Version 5.93 12-31-2015
1. New manual "ChatScript Common Beginner Mistakes"
2. time.tbl file removed from worlddata, its 2 concepts merged into ontology concepts, whose order of data has changed
concept: ~month_names (Apr April Aug August Dec December Feb February Jan January Jul July Jun June Mar March May may Nov November Oct October Sep Sept September )
concept: ~month_names_index DUPLICATE (3 3 7 7 11 11 1 1 0 0 6 6 5 5 2 2 4 4 10 10 9 9 8 8 8  )
concept: ~daysinmonth DUPLICATE (30 30 31 31 31 31 28 28 31 31 31 31 30 30 31 31 30 30 30 30 31 31 30 30  30) # 0-based

1. renamed ~verbs to ~verblist, ~prepositions to ~prepositionlist, ~adverbs to ~adverblist and
~adjectives to ~adjectivelist - these lists are not from the pos-tagger and should not be used 
in scripts. They are aggregation data about what is in the corresponding files in ONTOLOGY.
2. :show newline forces newlines to remain in the log file for respond: and start: lines.
3. renamed ^jsonprint to ^jsontree so you can remember it vs ^jsonwrite

for table control over setting canonicals.
6. ^jsondelete(factset jsonfact) will delete the fact and all facts referred to by it and if the
fact is an array fact, will renumber all later array value facts down 1.
7. ^jsonobjectinsert( object key value)  inserts key and value into object named
8. ^jsonarrayinsert(array value) adds value to end of array
9 ^jsoncreate({object array}) creates an empty json composite.

	( \test=5 ) means the entire token test=5 and not a comparison of test with 5
6.  No longer providing 32bit LINUX version executables. You need to build them yourself. Or tell me you want it.
	if there is enough demand, I will continue them.

version 5.7 9/27/2015
1. ^define takes a second argument of "all" or a third argument of "all" to display all meanings or of a particular sort.

1. in debugging manual documented all the individual :trace options


version 5.52
1.  filesxxx.txt files hunt order now includes RAWDATA folder.
2. Gambit now takes a series of things to try in order (up to 15) with FAIL as a final legal choice.
WARNING: Back at the beginning of CS 5.xxx ^gambit(PENDING) changed meaning to no longer include the 
current topic. But this can be "recreated" by doing ^GAMBIT(~ PENDING)
^gambit(~ PENDING ~mygeneral)
will do current topic, if no gambit then PENDING topics, if no gambit then ~mygeneral topic.
3. new command line parameter authorize=" ... " to supplement authorizations system for debug commands

2. GetRule(x y) takes 0 as y, meaning the top level rule above us.
3: :verify takes optional 1st param a variable indicating what tokencontrol value to use.


version 5.5
1. new script marker - 
describe: $myvar "used to store data"  _10 "tracks pos tag"
takes a $var or an _var or an @set or a ^macro or ~topic  and a text string and saves that as documentation. See :list
2. :list {$ ^ ~ _ @} will list documented items (and undocumented variables). See Finalizing a bot
3: ^sort now takes optional first argument alpha or alphabetic meaning sort by name instead of value. Also takes instead  "age" meaning put oldest facts first.
4. loop (@2) now uses count of set as loop control. Previously you could also use @2 to represent a count in patterns and IF tests.
5. :prepare now takes optional first argument, a user variable to set the tokencontrol to.
6. You can now control what tracing is done within a topic.  :trace ~topicname takes the current trace flags, uses them for that topic, and sets trace to 0. 
Therefore:  :trace basic match  ~topicname all  will set ~topicname to do those 2 kinds of traces and turn off regular trace, then turn on regular trace for everything else
7. :trace input  adds current input to the trace
7: removed the comment in a concept definition (use describe: instead).
8. concept definitions can now be annotated with ONLY_NOUNS or ONLY_VERBS or ONLY_ADJECTIVES or ONLY_ADVERBS. This requires that only the corresponding
interpretation of words can match, both in this set and in ALL concepts recursively referred to by this set. It is similar to marking a concept with
NOUN but doesn't actually change any existing property bits, merely requires them if the pos tagger can determine. ONLY_NONE added to a concept blocks
any propogate thru it

version 5.4 (extra stable)
1. serious bugs with << and %tense fixed
2. optional first flag to createfacts STRIP_QUOTES to remove quotes from arguments
3. userbugs table in postgres user client to record CS detected bugs

$$f = first(@1fact)
$$tmp = WriteFact($$f)
and
CreateFact($$tmp)  can get the fact back again

version 5.32
1. indirection can now be applied on a value:
   $tmp = ^$x   or   gambit(^$x)  will, if $x holds the name of a user or match variable, cycle indirectly thru $x to get the value of the named variable.
2.  :build can now define private canonical values for words using  canon: word value word value ...
3. ^burst(wordcount ...) replaced with ^burst(count ...)
3. ^explode removed, replace with ^burst(xxx "")
4. You can now use postgres as a fileserver to horizontally scale CS onto multiple servers - see postgres manual in Esoterica

3. ^DELETE can now kill an individual fact
4. ^conceptlist now requires a first argument of TOPIC CONCEPT or BOTH
5. ^incontext(label or topic.label) fails if the given label has not generated output within the 4 previous volleys. Succeeds if label has.

6. new command line params users= and logs= to set directories.
7. optional 1st argument "once" to ^burst, makes the burst return the first separation and then the rest of the value unburst.
8. you can now wildcard word spellings with an * in front as well. Eg  u: ( *ator ) matches "I ate a reactor"
9. ^setwildcardindex(val)  tells a pattern match to resume dishing out wildcard slots at the given val (so you don't clobber prexisting useful values)

version 4.7b
1. ^conceptlist takes optional 1st argument of (CONCEPT or TOPIC or BOTH), returns the set referenced.
2. :extratopic filename  will import that file which was written by :topicdump of a topic, and convert it into internal binary format suitable for a PerformChatWithTopic, and in local mode will disable the topic named in the binary(if there is one) and add the binary and use PerformChatWithTopic instead of PerformChat. Used to test the PerformChatWithTopic interface.

version 4.6b
1. prefixing username on startup with * in client or stand-alone mode, allows
user to speak first.

version 4.6
1. the stand alone system recognizes 3 oob messages:
	alarm=xxx
	callback=xxx
	loopback=xxx
If alarm is set, an incoming [alarm] will be sent to CS after the xxx milliseconds have been completed after completion of any current volley.

If a callback is set, an incoming [callback] will be sent to CS after xxx milliseconds, unless the user starts typing first, in which case the callback is cancelled

If a loopback is set, an incoming [loopback] will be sent to CS xxx milliseconds after
the most recent output, unless the user starts typing first, in which case it resets and tries again after the next volley

2. new parameter output=  sets a line length limit for output of chatbot forcing \r\n as needed
3. disable(rule ~) disables current rule

7. new folder WEBINTERFACE holds the old index.php script under SIMPLE, and  improved scripts under BETTER support the 3 oob messages as well as scrollable log

version 4.5
1. if the filesxxx file is not found at the top level of CS, it will also look at the containing folder. THerefore you can put your own rawdata and filesxxx build files in there, put the CS folder in there, and update CS by merely replacing the CS folder entirely. If you have your own livedata, it can be in that outer folder and a command
line parameter tells CS to use it instead of the default folder.
2. system= and english=  can be used to redirect accessing those folders within LIVEDATA. This means you can make your own copy of livedata (eg above cs) and then redirect CS to that to have your substitutions, but redirect these 2 folders to stay within chatscript for updating.
3. :conceptlist to list all concepts or all matching a pattern like ~ye*
4. documented :concepts which if given a word, lists all concepts affiliated with it.

6. documented more codes for query scripts (S V O in section 1)
7. altered ^first,last,pick to accept @0raw and field to accept @0 raw

version 4.4d
1. noticable bug relating to multiword recognition like "creme brulee" in dictionary fixed.

2. ^Getverify(tag) will retrieve the verify tag content if it exists in the VERIFY directory
3. concept declaration can now have property UPPERCASE_MATCH, when used with _~concept in pattern match, result will force uppercase wildcard storage regardless of how you entered the words (storing the title or name of someone)
4. :trace reject  shows you what messages were not given because they repeated.
5. ^result(stream)  evaluates the stream, traps ANY return code and returns the text of the return code.

version 4.4b
1. :trace SAMPLE displays the sample input when tracing a rule.
2. definition of << >> pattern match modified to set the matching location AFTER the >> to be just like the start of a match, ie something that looks like < * (match the next listed token anywhere in the sentence).
3. ^phase(_0 noun) returns noun phrase running thru here
   ^phrase(_0 preposition) does it for prep phrases
   ^phrase(_0 verbal) does it for verbals;

8. USER_FLAG1 .. USER_FLAG4 now defined as marks you can put on facts.
9. if 1st arg to ^setposition is a match var, then it will take 2 more args (start + end) and set the position data for that matchvar.

version 4.4

   was changed from _ separation to " " separation, but I neglected to change burst 
   default. Now rectified. BUT... if you had ^burst(_3 _) code you've written, it is
