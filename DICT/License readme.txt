Foreign dictionaries come from Treetagger.  http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/

Note that for commercial use, you will need to get a license, at which point you will be able to use the
pos-tagger integrated into CS directly.  Contact Bruce Wilcox if you need to arrange a license. The
cost is on the order of 1,000 Euro or so per language for life.
