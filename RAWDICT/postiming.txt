 The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced "no evidence"  that any irregularities took place .
 The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , "deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta"  for the manner in which the election was conducted .
 The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible "irregularities"  in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr .
 "Only a relative handful of such reports was received"  , the jury said , "considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city"  .
 The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws "are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous"  .
 It recommended that Fulton legislators act "to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them"  .
 The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said "are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments"  .
 However , the jury said it believes "these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration"  .
 The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , "is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies"  .
 It urged that the city "take steps to remedy"  this problem .
 Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .
 It urged that the next Legislature "provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected"  .
 The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .
 "This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program"  , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department "has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money"  .
 The jurors said they realize "a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties"  .
 Nevertheless , "we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds"  , the jurors said .
 "Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden"  on Fulton taxpayers .
 The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .
 The jury said it found the court "has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations"  of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee .
 "These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms"  , the jury said .
 Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended "that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences"  .
 The jury did not elaborate , but it added that "there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable"  .
 On other matters , the jury recommended that : Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and "a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail"  .
 Fulton legislators "work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable"  pension plan for city employes .
 The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department .
 Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday .
 His petition charged mental cruelty .
 The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 .
 They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin .
 Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .
 The petition listed the mayor's occupation as "attorney"  and his age as 71 .
 It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala .
 The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year .
 The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. NE .
 Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney .
 Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 .
 His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 .
 The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1 .
 He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection .
 Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said Wednesday .
 Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .
 State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker .
 In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .
 Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended .
 When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no  --  and there were no dissents .
 The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system  --  a system which the party opposes in its platform .
 Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign .
 Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time .
 He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years .
 When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd .
 The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home  --  where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .
 Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .
 Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .
 Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .
 Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .
 The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways .
 A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work .
 The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .
 Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin .
 The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .
 Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .
 Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the "quickie"  vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .
 While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 .
 A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 .
 As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .
 Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions .
 A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past .
 Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to "endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended"  as state funds .
 Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there "are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed"  .
 But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .
 The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday .
 It says that "in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds"  , the State Board of Education should be directed to "give priority"  to teacher pay raises .
 After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the "coolest election I ever saw in this county"  .
 The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee .
 Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election , and Bush got 402 .
 Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order .
 "This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw"  , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said .
 "Being at the polls was just like being at church . I did n't smell a drop of liquor , and we did n't have a bit of trouble"  .
 .
 The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however .
 It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .
 The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .
 During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .
 Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .
 Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .
 Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .
 "Everything went real smooth"  , the sheriff said .
 "There was n't a bit of trouble"  .
 Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's "abandoned property"  act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers .
 Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation .
 Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .
 But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .
 Daniel termed "extremely conservative"  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 .
 He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books "since Texas was a republic"  .
 It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .
 The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .
 The escheat law can not be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared .
 Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .
 "If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy"  , he said .
 "You take out of circulation many millions of dollars"  .
 Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount "to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies"  .
 His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin .
 Cox argued that the bill is "probably unconstitutional"  since , he said , it would impair contracts .
 He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday .
 Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties .
 The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .
 There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House .
 It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here .
 Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate .
 The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school .
 DALLAS MAY GET to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff .
 While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .
 "We're getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting"  , said Ratcliff .
 "But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . I'm willing to stake my political career on it"  .
 .
 Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .
 A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later .
 THE HOUSE passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities .
 THE SENATE quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar .
 One validated acts of school districts .
 Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District .
 The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .
 WITHOUT DISSENT , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district .
 Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .
 TWO TAX REVISION bills were passed .
 One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .
 Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine .
 It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League .
 THE OTHER BILL , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .
 NATURAL GAS public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen III of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .
 MARSHALL FORMBY of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections .
 Under Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court .
 State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay .
 An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator .
 Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .
 The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 .
 The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said .
 Opponents generally argued that the ballot could n't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .
 All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent .
 Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday .
 Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people .
 When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas .
 Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse .
 The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .
 Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .
 Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack .
 The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) de la Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs .
 "This is a poor boy's bill"  , said Chapman .
 "Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . This would help the little peanut districts"  .
 .
 A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning "educational methods"  .
 Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called "teaching methods"  courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate .
 A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours .
 Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .
 The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects .
 "A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools"  , said Grover .
 College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses .
 Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal .
 The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school's new president .
 Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term .
 Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma .
 He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas A&I College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College , Weatherford , Okla .
 In addition , Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
 During his college career , Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman .
 Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville , Texas , High School , as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays , Kan. , State College .
 He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army .
 Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland .
 State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a "blue ribbon"  citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .
 The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load .
 The report called racial discrimination in employment "one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency"  .
 The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman .
 "We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence"  , Martin said .
 The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .
 These , he said , are "two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC"  .
 Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity .
 Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy .
 Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday .
 The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .
 Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial .
 Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom .
 "The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client"  , Bellows told the court .
 "Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others"  .
 .
 Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , "You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this"  ?
 "Yes , your honor"  , replied Bellows .
 "What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case . There is a conflict among the defendants"  .
 .
 President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio .
 The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone .
 Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port , Mass. , a White House spokesman said the address text still had "quite a way to go"  toward completion .
 Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , "I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts"  .
 Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city .
 The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally illegal means"  .
 Karns said that the cases involved a matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence"  of the 50 persons .
 He said evidence was obtained "in violation of the legal rights of citizens"  .
 Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases .
 In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been "unable to make a case"  .
 Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler , special prosecutor .
 Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury .
 Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation .
 Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning .
 Karns said it was a "wrongful act"  for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand jury room"  .
 He said this constituted a "very serious misuse"  of the Criminal court processes .
 "Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court"  , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court .
 Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .
 Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with "complementary"  miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .
 The cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .
 The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns .
 Two other cases also were under advisement .
 After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them .
 President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .
 The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research .
 The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill .
 It was defeated in Congress last year .
 It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .
 The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent  --  3 per cent on each worker and employer  --  on the first $4,800 of pay per year .
 The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent  --  3.25 per cent each .
 Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .
 The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .
 Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 .
 Both figures would go higher in later years .
 Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .
 These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes .
 The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .
 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .
 A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a "unit formula"  allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit .
 Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient .
 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .
 The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .
 He said his plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings  --  or those of their children  --  caused by an extended hospital stay"  .
 "This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs"  , he said , "and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . "This is not a program of socialized medicine . It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital"  .
 .
 The plan does not cover doctor bills .
 They would still be paid by the patient .
 Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .
 The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools can not now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .
 Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they ca n't afford the schooling costs .
 The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .
 The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student .
 In addition , the government would pay a $1,000 "cost of education"  grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants .
 Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .
 The President recommended federal "matching grants"  totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .
 In the area of "community health services"  , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .
 He asked for another 10 million dollar "initial"  appropriation for "stimulatory grants"  to states to improve nursing homes .
 He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .
 In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau .
 He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .
 The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .
 He did not say by how much .
 For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities .
 The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .
 The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable elements in a sound health program  --  people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them"  .
 Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .
 Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan .
 Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .
 Senate Republican Leader Dirksen [ Ill. ] and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck [ Ind. ] said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .
 Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .
 House Speaker Sam Rayburn [ D. , Tex. ] called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing"  , but made no prediction on its fate in the House .
 Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief .
 Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .
 A number of scattered "ayes"  and "noes"  was heard .
 Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .
 In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .
 The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse [ D. , Ore. ] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 .
 The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .
 This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .
 In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems .
 This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the "colonialist"  powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems .
 The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicious by its absence .
 In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .
 The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council .
 There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance .
 Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive .
 Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line .
 On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .
 One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as "inconclusive"  .
 But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .
 A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited .
 The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .
 The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .
 But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , "cornerstone"  of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters .
 The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .
 The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .
 The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .
 This increase in the "threshold"  , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come .
 Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled .
 The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .
 There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos .
 The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam .
 They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this .
 The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated .
 But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .
 The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference .
 This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .
 It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .
 Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .
 But with the months moving on  --  and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world  --  the question arises : How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ?
 Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union .
 He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory .
 It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it .
 They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders"  in Cuba .
 One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score .
 His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .
 But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .
 The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination .
 Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators .
 This group pleads with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups"  .
 It recommends that the United States "seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds"  .
 Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation .
 But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated .
 Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors .
 Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .
 Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .
 Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .
 But thus far there has been no response in kind .
 Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .
 In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture .
 Again and again it asked the Communists to "freeze"  the military situation in Laos .
 But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate .
 And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a "great service"  and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .
 SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos .
 But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos .
 Some SEATO nations disagreed , however .
 There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam .
 The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos .
 The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist"  government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army .
 There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt .
 If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them .
 One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
 He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal"  of Prince Souvanna .
 The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States .
 The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the "vitality of the nation"  .
 In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .
 The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .
 The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant ot the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime . His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes .
 Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council "or anyone else locally"  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .
 East Providence now has no civil defense program .
 Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years .
 He is not interested in being named a full-time director .
 Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .
 He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .
 Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job .
 One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said .
 Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . Mr. Hawksley said .
 One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .
 Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said .
 Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .
 He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area .
 Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .
 The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another .
 Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point .
 Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .
 Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .
 If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .
 One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid .
 Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .
 Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .
 Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly .
 The governor's move into the so-called "blue law"  controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls .
 A copy was released to the press .
 Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant .
 The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .
 While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views"  .
 He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said .
 "I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings"  , Mr. Notte said , "to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws"  .
 The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales"  .
 The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .
 Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation .
 There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws .
 The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath .
 The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday .
 The only day they "have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday"  , the council's resolution said .
 The small shops "must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community"  , according to the resolution , which added that they "also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors"  .
 It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue"  to the local government .
 The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business"  on Sunday .
 They "operate on a volume basis"  , it was contended , "and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community"  .
 Liberals and conservatives in both parties  --  Democratic and Republican  --  should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday .
 Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the "welfare"  type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .
 He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .
 He said he was "confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910"  .
 That , he added , was when he was "a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . "That was before I studied law . Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party . The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track . He steered me to the right track  --  the free enterprise track"  .
 .
 He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .
 He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .
 Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , "Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product  --  but neither told us how to achieve it"  .
 He said he favors wage increases for workers  --  "but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze"   --  and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added .
 Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : "A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own"  .
 Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling .
 A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .
 William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr .
 The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post .
 Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .
 He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .
 A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .
 Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .
 Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .
 He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .
 Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .
 He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .
 "After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it"  , he declared .
 "It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement"  .
 He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .
 "Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement"  , he indicated , "and to tell them what this will mean for the town"  .
 He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September .
 Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .
 Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated .
 Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed "false pretenses"  .
 Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system .
 Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting .
 Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance .
 At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .
 Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .
 At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition .
 Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .
 James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism"  .
 Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .
 The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .
 It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs .
 Hughes said Monday , "It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . Now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state"  .
 .
 Sunday he had added , "We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president ... but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership"  .
 Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .
 "How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this"  ?
 he asked .
 The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican "and proud to have absorbed his philosophy"  while working in his adminstration .
 Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue .
 Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .
 "He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign"  , he said , "because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign"  .
 The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark .
 Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .
 He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .
 State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry .
 Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate "Must share the blame for this"  .
 Nothing that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .
 "But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time"  , Mitchell said .
 Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell .
 He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises .
 "He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you ca n't have it both ways"  , Jones said .
 The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , "and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue"  .
 Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : "I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . His reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . "I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . "Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit"  .
 .
 Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .
 Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones .
 Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .
 Sandman said : "The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case R-N.J. , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he can not answer any questions about New Jersey's problems . "We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . That failed . "We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year . That , too , will fail"  .
 .
 Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee .
 Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman .
 County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .
 The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a "lip service word"  .
 Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .
 Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 .
 Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .
 The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner .
 Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals .
 "My experience as public safety commissioner"  , Roos said , "has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . Jim Sheeran fits that description"  .
 .
 William J. Seidel , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service .
 A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state .
 Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies .
 In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section .
 Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting .
 He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station .
 He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens .
 He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education .
 Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge "to carry the issues to every corner of the state"  .
 He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : "When I come back here after the November election you'll think , You're my man  --  you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected"  .
 He said , "We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time"  .
 In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , "The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . But we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson . "We'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November"  .
 .
 He said , "You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead"  .
 .
 He urged New Jersey to "become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy"  .
 He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .
 "We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean"  , the former Superior Court judge said .
 "To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s"  .
 Calling the Democrats the "party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people"  , Hughes asked , "a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November"  .
 Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's "Green Acres"  plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .
 He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday .
 The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state .
 The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis .
 Hughes said , "This is not a plan to conquer space  --  but to conserve it"  , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 .
 He said "Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve"  .
 Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved .
 He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans .
 "After the primary"  , he promised , "I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee"  .
 .
 Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring  --  voluntarily  --  this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .
 The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by .
 There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters .
 A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .
 She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment .
 She served one four-year term on the national committee .
 Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates .
 At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable .
 Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .
 The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .
 Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .
 Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary .
 These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city .
 Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor .
 In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader .
 As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leader .
 He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party .
 Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation .
 Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .
 In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket .
 But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor .
 The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller .
 The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx .
 After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's New York Times .
 The Mayor said : "It did n't come from me . But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates"  .

 A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts .
 There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics .
 The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are "all the same"  .
 "It's See Joe , see Jim"  , he says .
 "The hand is out"  .
 A political scientist writes of the growth of "alienated voters"  , who "believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . ... These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them"  .
 .
 Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel , "The Last Hurrah"  .
 But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .
 A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .
 Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations .
 And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state .
 A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life .
 Day after day some new episode is reported .
 The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property .
 An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate .
 Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .
 In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .
 In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill .
 The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee .
 It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain .
 The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor .
 Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday .
 The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans .
 The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week .
 The $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families .
 It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .
 The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy .
 They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts .
 What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 .
 This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics .
 Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee .
 About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps .
 In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .
 Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview .
 Six of these were proposed by religious groups .
 They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America .
 Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals .
 There are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .
 When he protested , the hotel owner said : "Why do you worry ?
 The U. S. Government is paying for it . The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers"  .
 .
 "I do n't work for the Government"  , the American said .
 "I'm a missionary"  .
 The hotel owner shrugged .
 "Same thing"  , he said .
 And then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ?
 R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can .
 No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes .
 At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming : "Look , he took everything I had"  !
 Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker .
 Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid .
 The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations .
 The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates .
 This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .
 In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries .
 A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations .
 This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations .
 One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India .
 India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants .
 The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report .
 The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations .
 The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week .
 The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start .
 Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts .
 Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point .
 The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom .
 The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces .
 The latter two are half-brothers .
 Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos .
 An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded .
 But no one was overly optimistic .
 W. Averell Harriman of the United States , Malcolm MacDonald of Britain , Maurice Couve de Murville , France's Foreign Minister , and Howard C. Green , Canada's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference .
 The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week .
 Princess Moune , Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter , read the Princes' statement .
 They had a two-hour luncheon together in "an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation"  , she said .
 The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days .
 The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .
 The meetings in Zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government .
 Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company .
 Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned .
 The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department .
 He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college .
 From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps .
 While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill .
 Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans .
 He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 .
 They reside at 4911 Miles dr .
 Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 .
 Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route .
 Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint .
 But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .
 Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments .
 Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world .
 Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high .
 Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old .
 In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .
 They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote .
 In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .
 Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept .
 Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation .
 Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground .
 Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square , opposite the White House .
 In this historic square are several statutes , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans .
 Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units .
 About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .
 Division one of the parade will be the service academies .
 Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson .
 Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .
 Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states .
 Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , Guam , American Samoa , the trust territories and the Canal Zone .
 What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ?
 Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future .
 This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants  --  Gov. Ross Barnett .
 Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .
 Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .
 Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .
 The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office .
 There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble .
 Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful "honeymoon"  he had in the 1960 legislative session .
 If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .
 The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year .
 Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .
 Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .
 The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .
 With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .
 Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .
 Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck .
 And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .
 Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary .
 With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .
 Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status .
 Reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .
 The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .
 The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .
 But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue  --  that of finances in state government .
 The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .
 The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .
 But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .
 Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .
 The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .
 The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .
 The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes .
 Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy .
 If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .
 He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .
 Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .
 Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .
 This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .
 They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .
 Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition .
 He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .
 Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .
 It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .
 But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .
 This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration  --  the shortage of cash .
 It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .
 If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .
 Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .
 In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .
 The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .
 It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .
 But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .
 This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .
 A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .
 Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .
 The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .
 City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had "an inside track"  with the city .
 Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 .
 Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the "legitimate"  bids of competing contractors .
 The Hughes concern then took "shortcuts"  on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said .
 The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract .
 The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .
 The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project .
 Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor .
 Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .
 The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 .
 The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2d st. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law .
 On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization .
 Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish , Jr .
 The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms , Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co .
 At Berger's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .
 "I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated"  , Berger said .
 The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track .
 The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints .
 The city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , Hemphill charged .
 Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint .
 The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $600 per joint .
 But , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint .
 Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference .
 Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company .
 "We wo n't know the full amount until we get a full report"  , Wagner said .
 "We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond"  , Berger said .
 Wagner replied , "Ca n't you just see the headline : City Hooked for $172,000"  ?
 Berger insisted that "we know enough to sue for the full amount"  .
 Douglas M. Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El .
 "We want to find out who knew about it"  , Pratt said .
 "Certain people must have known about it"  .
 "The PTC is investigating the whole matter"  , Pratt said .
 Samuel D. Goodis , representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .
 Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee .
 For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , Goodis said .
 His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services .
 The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that .
 The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room .
 The cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 .
 Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels .
 The city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year .
 The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan , spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses .
 A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs .
 The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog .
 Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care .
 In reply , Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees .
 He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A. ; $15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites .
 City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year .
 The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said .
 The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis .
 Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday , it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car .
 The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower , Davenport said .
 Barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess , and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time .
 He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning .
 Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery , 39 .
 His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation .
 The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project .
 The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .
 One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 The tract is bounded by Island ave. , Dicks ave. , 61st st. , and Eastwick ave .
 It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores .
 The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm , a Philadelphia builder , for work in the project .
 The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp. , a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project .
 The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis , former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp .
 The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic .
 It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project .
 The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave. , which on original plans ran through the center of the development .
 The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project .
 The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work .
 Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles .
 He was in Baptist Memorial hospital .
 The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work .
 "I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway"  , he said .
 Gladden's wife and two of his sons , John , 17 , and Jim , 13 , were inside the house .
 The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall .
 The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house .
 The left front wheel landed 100 feet away .
 Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either TNT or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel .
 It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter .
 Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night .
 The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union .
 Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 .
 The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing .
 A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City , Kas .
 The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett .
 Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee .
 Both have been active in the association .
 Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president .
 An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat .
 By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government .
 The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president .
 Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months .
 The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned .
 Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own .
 Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney .
 Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 .
 Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 .
 He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law .
 He is married and the father of three children .
 Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E. M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night .
 Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D. C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel .
 He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths .
 "We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours"  , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty .
 Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union .
 He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , "so long as people rebel , we must not give up"  .
 Martin called for patience on the part of Americans .
 "The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build"  , he said .
 By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said .
 "We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient"  , the assistant secretary said .
 Economically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves .
 Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves .
 The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a "social cost"  .
 Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country .
 The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack .
 But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow .
 The board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating .
 Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go .
 Dr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would "be more fruitful"  , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district .
 "Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster"  , he said .
 "Nobody really expects to evacuate . I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . Mrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they "please take a stand"  .
 , said , "We must have faith in somebody  --  on the local level , and it would n't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children"  .
 Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars "might not be realistic and would not work"  .
 Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program .
 The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting .
 It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done .

 Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session .
 A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January .
 Last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system .
 Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov. 15 , the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools .

 A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial Coliseum .
 The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 .
 The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible .
 The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible .
 At the adoption , the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , "The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives"  .
 Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list .
 The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : "The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct"  .
 The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and :  --  emphasizes the Virgin birth  --  the sinless life of Christ  --  His miracles  --  His substitutionary work on the cross  --  His bodily resurrection from the dead  --  and His exaltation to the right hand of God .
 Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God .
 His offices are in Springfield , Mo .
 Election came on the nominating ballot .
 Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , "Breakthrough"  scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years .
 In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with "Breakthrough"  the theme for the first two years .
 The Rev. R. L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work .
 "Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church . This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life"  .
 , he told delegates Friday .
 Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1 minutes , he said "our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge"  .
 "In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches"  , the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons .
 "In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; 800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none"  , he said .
 To step up the denomination's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years .
 To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said .
 "The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour"  .
 A capsule view of proposed plans includes :  --  Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches .
 Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers .
 Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) .
 Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches .
 U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial .
 Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict .
 In denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that "a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are"  .
 Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide .
 Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : "It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out"  .
 In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case .
 The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .
 Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draought as they coasted along with a 3-to-0 advantage .
 Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthandler who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .
 Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock .
 A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .
 With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle .
 Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt .
 Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .
 Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center .
 The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers .
 Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one .
 Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium .
 The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth .
 Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph .
 Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .
 In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left .
 Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls .
 Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce .
 Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short .
 John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest .
 The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate .
 The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out .
 Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally .
 Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error .
 Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners .
 When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey .
 The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center .
 Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first .
 It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit .
 Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play .
 Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center .
 If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon .
 The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training .
 Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players .
 The big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league "rookie-of-the year"  , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City  --  the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row .
 The 6-foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .
 He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence .
 When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180  --  "too light for me to be at my best"  he said .
 "I feel good physically"  , Hansen added , "but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now"  .
 The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set "improved fielding"  as his 1961 goal .
 "I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a little better"  , he said .
 Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees .
 Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm , the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest .
 Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League , are the probable rival pitchers .
 Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M. encounter .
 Ralph Houk , successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg , including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games .
 The famed Yankee Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach .
 Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort Knox , Ky .
 The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen .
 Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit .
 "Take a ride on this one"  , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight .
 It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate .
 Just before game time , Robinson's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer .
 Unfortunately , Brooks' teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers .
 Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee MacPhail ; J. A. W. Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board of directors , and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn .
 Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane .
 Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney , now catching for the A's is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast .
 "But they should da brought in Tokyo , too"  , added Old Scrapiron .
 "Then we'd really have someplace to go"  .
 Gaining her second straight victory , Norman B. Small , Jr.'s Garden Fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight .
 Toying with her field in the early stages , Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs .
 Richard M. Forbes's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss .
 A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program .
 Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday .
 Garden Fresh , the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve .
 She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event .
 George Kerr , the swift-striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight , beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 .
 Kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .
 Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield .
 Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .
 Then Kerr , a graduate student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn .
 Mills was timed in 1.10.4 .
 The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run .
 Mrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 .
 She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio .
 Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here .
 Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season .
 While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician .
 Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today .
 A Texas halfback who does n't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games .
 Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field .
 Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick  --  several every Saturday , in fact  --  out of football .
 Moritz does n't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl .
 That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .
 He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State .
 Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .
 But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , "place-kicker"  .
 A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .
 Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he did n't get into a single game .
 "This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me"  , said Moritz .
 "So I started practicing on it in spring training . Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . "I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school"  .
 , he said , "and made 26 in a row at one time . I never did miss one in a playoff game  --  I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years"  .
 .
 Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .
 He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 .
 His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .
 He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later .
 But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .
 Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared .
 "Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them ca n't seem to get the feel . Practice helps you to get your timing down . "It's kind of like golf  --  if you do n't swing a club very often , your timing gets off"  .
 .
 Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .
 "If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead"  , he explained .
 In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ... their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries ... .
 Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games ... .
 Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench ... .
 Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma ... .
 Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : "That wo n't last long"  .
 It did n't ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four ... .
 A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University .
 The Mustangs do n't play this week .
 "We're just real happy for the players"  , Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy .
 "I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal )"  .
 .
 Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as "a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . We needed it and we got it"  .
 .
 Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon .
 Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .
 "Nelson played magnificent football"  , Meek praised .
 "He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football"  .
 .
 Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages .
 One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory .
 "As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it"  , Meek said .
 "He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around . He really crucified him ... he nailed it for a yard loss"  .
 .
 The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .
 "He just lay back there and waited for it"  , Meek said .
 "He almost brought it back all the way"  .
 Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .
 "Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game"  , Meek said .
 "He'll be out of action all this week . He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game . There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee"  .
 .
 Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland .
 "He's looking a lot better , and he's able to run"  , Meek explained .
 "We'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I do n't know if he'll be able to play"  .
 The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .
 "We'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday"  , Meek said , "and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . We'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off"  .
 .
 SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday , Oct. 21 .
 Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas A&M ... Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday  --  mud or no mud ... End Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury ... The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday  --  a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday ... Halfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined TCU's workout Monday .
 The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts  --  a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos  --  but their visit will be a short one .
 The Texans have two more road games  --  at Buffalo and Houston  --  before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .
 Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb .
 Rabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions .
 "Just our luck"  !
 exclaimed Stram .
 "Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way"  .
 Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .
 "Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well"  , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .
 "In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job"  .
 The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .
 "We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack"  , explained Stram .
 "They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang  --  they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble"  .
 The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .
 The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback .
 He was called upon 26 times  --  more than all of the other ball-carriers combined  --  and delivered 145 yards .
 The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .
 A quick touchdown resulted .
 "That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away"  , said Stram , quipping , "I think I'll put that play in the book"  .
 The early Southwest Conference football leaders  --  Texas , Arkansas and Texas A&M  --  made a big dent in the statistics last week .
 Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high .
 Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A&M , with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .
 Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .
 Texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ) .
 A&M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game .
 Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
 Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 .
 The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area .
 It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight .
 They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack .
 Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning .
 He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .
 The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged .
 Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack .
 After Al Paschal gruonded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe .
 Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left .
 Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout .
 The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove .
 Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth .
 Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infielder roller accounted for the tallies .
 The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert .
 Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth .
 Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .
 Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .
 Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits ... It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order ... The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark ... Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ ... Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage .
 ... Lefty Wyman Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night ... Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn .
 Kenny Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night .
 Billy Gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday .
 Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center .
 He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans .
 It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year .
 Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss .
 The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left .
 The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits  --  a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon  --  a walk and a sacrifice fly .
 Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard .
 Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth  --  his fourth homer of the campaign  --  tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front .
 A double by Green , Allison's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth .
 Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball .
 "I've had it"  , he told a newsman .
 "I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club"  .
 This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout .
 Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a .130 batting average in the first 12 games .
 He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited .
 She said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : "I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances"  .
 The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes .
 Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him .
 The conductor said to Ritchie : "I do n't think you want to talk to him . You'll probably get a ball bat on the head . He's mad at the world"  .
 .
 But Jackie had gone into the station .
 Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand .
 "I told him who I was and he was quite cold . But he warmed up after a while . I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . He said he had never talked to Liston"  .
 .
 Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : "I ca n't hit anymore . I ca n't run . I ca n't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . JUST WHEN IT SEEMS baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday . Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , "Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history . Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al . Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade . I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . "SPAHNIE DOES N'T KNOW how to merely go through the motions"  .
 , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .
 The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .
 Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience .
 Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field .
 Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road .
 WILLIE'S BIG DAY REVIVED the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle .
 This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee .
 The record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace .
 In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .
 Once the figure was 30-30 .
 Willie's lifetime batting average of .318 is 11 points beyond Mickey's .
 The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park .
 It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .
 THE DENVER-AREA TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home .
 This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers .
 The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the "Living Room Athletic Club"  when games were cut off .
 Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .
 This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .
 There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .
 It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level .
 You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .
 This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .
 The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale .
 With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game .
 Johnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning .
 Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .
 The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors .
 The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud .
 In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on .
 Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .
 In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really did n't matter .
 The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager .
 Only Bucky Harris , the "boy-manager"  of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .
 Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach .
 Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year .
 He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season .
 The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff  --  Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer .
 Williams is a defensive coach .
 Gauer works with the ends .
 The selection had been expected .
 Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry .
 Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday .
 Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .
 With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing .
 In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials .
 Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack  --  split between running and passing .
 Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers .
 An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season .
 He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 .
 He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y .
 He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach .
 Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers .
 The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 .
 Skorich began his new job auspiciously today .
 At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship .
 Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .
 With the announcement of a "special achievement award"  to William A. ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel .
 Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees .
 Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award .
 Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series .
 Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award .
 To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year .
 A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song .
 The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York .
 Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly .
 His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city .
 The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees .
 Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward .
 When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here .
 When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise .
 The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .
 The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson .
 A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick .
 Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .
 Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I .
 Bill Jr. , 20 ; Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family .
 Shea was born in Manhattan .
 He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington .
 He played basketball there while working toward a law degree .
 Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team .
 He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League .
 All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday .
 On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager .
 Maris is in line for a big raise .
 Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight .
 The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre .
 Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin .
 Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards .
 The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .
 Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .
 The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri .
 ARNOLD PALMER has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .
 He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money .
 He was heralded as "Sportsman of the Year"  by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the "Professional Athlete of the Year"  , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt .
 But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .
 A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .
 It made him human .
 And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .
 If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all .
 It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold .
 He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .
 The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .
 He boomed a 280-yard drive .
 Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .
 On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot .
 The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice .
 He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .
 He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .
 "It is possible that I over-corrected"  , he said ruefully .
 Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .
 So he wound up with a dozen .
 "It was a nice round figure , that 12"  , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed .
 From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open .
 The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open .
 Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .
 Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count .
 "How many is that , Jim"  ?
 asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project .
 "Thirteen"  , said Long Jim .
 "Nae , man"  , said Willie , "ye must be countin' the echoes"  .
 He had a 16 .
 Palmer's dozen were honestly earned .
 Nor were there any rules to save him .
 If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .
 This knowledge has come in handy , too .
 His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .
 The ball floated downstream .
 A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .
 Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association .
 Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .
 "I knew it all along"  , confessed Arnold with a grin , "but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there"  .
 For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .
 Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors .
 He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right .
 That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 .
 It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder .
 Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force .
 "I can remove the ball , ca n't I"  ?
 asked Palmer of an official .
 "No"  , said the official .
 "You must play it where it lies"  .
 "You're wrong"  , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules .
 "I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling"  .
 He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one .
 The golfing fathers ruled in his favor .
 So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .
 Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .
 But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before .
 A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today .
 Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments .
 The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division .
 However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .
 Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : "We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other"  .
 Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .
 The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12.01 A.M. next Saturday .
 The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 .
 Howard E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said , "A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action"  .
 The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates .
 It will be accomplished in two ways : A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions .
 There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class .
 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense .
 Since the railroad can not reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B.&O. spokesman said .
 Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages .
 The spokesman said the number to be furloughed can not be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .
 A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount streets .
 The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery .
 The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money .
 The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit .
 He said the assailant , who was armed with a .45-caliber automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue and Gold street .
 In another attack , Samuel Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him .
 A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home .
 The victim Darnell Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis .
 His sister and brother , Marie Louise , 3 , and John Raymond , Jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital .
 The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body .
 The boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back .
 His condition was reported to be fair .
 Police said the children's mother , Mrs. Eleanor Somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred .
 The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park , at Jones Station , police said .
 The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what .
 The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting .
 The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .
 Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval .
 "I hate to have these things come up again and again"  , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion .
 "These are the board's minutes . I'll write what you tell me to"  .
 .
 For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .
 It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him .
 The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .
 Dr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do so .
 State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D. , First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt street .
 He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance .
 Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side .
 His condition was said to be , "fair"  .
 Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street .
 He called Vincent L. Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance .
 The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are "deficiencies"  in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible .
 Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .
 Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .
 He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December .
 Equipment should be in operation "almost immediately after the first snowfall"  , Mr. Schaefer said .
 The Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for "halting snow operations"  on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm .
 Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week .
 What he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest .
 Work resumed Wednesday , he said .
 Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be "strictly enforced"  .
 Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas "not be overlooked ... if our small merchants are to survive"  .
 Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .
 The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention .
 The victims were H. Malone Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46 .
 Each had been shot in the back several times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle , according to Capt. Elmer Hagner , chief of Anne Arundel detectives .
 Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail .
 The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court .
 Soon after 10 A.M. , when police reached the 1-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor .
 Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said .
 The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car .
 The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio .
 Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs .
 Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service station , just outside Annapolis .
 The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station , police said .
 Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland's Secretary of State .
 Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals .
 Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday .
 Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child .
 Now 38 , Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947 .
 Five years later , he was awarded the university's degree in law .
 Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958 .
 From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates .
 MARYLAND contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000 , up 10 per cent compared to October , 1960 , F. W. Dodge , Dodge Corporation , reported .
 Dodge reported the following breakdown : Nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent .
 The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year .
 A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : Nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent .
 Residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter .
 The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time .
 In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction .
 While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field .
 Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo J. Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .
 "Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960"  .
 , Pantas predicted .
 SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section .
 Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures .
 Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct .
 Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies .
 The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .
 Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems .
 CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation .
 Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today .
 The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year .
 It is a killer sub  --  that is , a hunter of enemy subs .
 It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine .
 Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack .
 The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow st. police court here at the end of a three day hearing .
 A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced .
 They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .
 Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian altho he carries a Canadian passport .
 When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified .
 A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce .
 [ In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City .
 ] In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .
 Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript .
 All five pleaded innocent .
 Only Miss Gee asked for bail .
 Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop .
 "I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them"  , said the magistrate , K. J. P. Baraclough .
 The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison .
 Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s .
 Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior .
 He promptly went to communist East Germany .
 The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks .
 "This is Russian money"  , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office .
 He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets .
 The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier .
 But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds .
 He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 .
 The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .
 Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold .
 The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve .
 So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .
 Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet .
 Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed .
 The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack .
 With the machinery went a complete design for the hull .
 The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it .
 "Much of the navy's future depends upon her"  , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station .
 It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .
 "Her basic hull form [ a teardrop ] and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines"  , the statement went on .
 The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp .
 Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said .
 The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .
 It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 .
 The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built .
 Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers .
 It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month .
 It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes .
 The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture "of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future"  .
 The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified .
 Range was a vital detail .
 Designs of parts were sought .
 Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid .
 Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested .
 The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives "is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity"  on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court .
 The three  --  Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin  --  and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .
 In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were "entirely innocent"  .
 "When they became members of the city police narcotics unit"  , Sokol said , "they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers"  .
 .
 Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were "aiming at the same criminals"  .
 This , he added , brought about "petty jealousies"  and "petty personal grievances"  .
 "In the same five year period that the United States says they [ the detectives ] were engaged in this conspiracy"  , Sokol continued , "these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal"  .
 In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments .
 Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt .
 Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana av .
 Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears .
 The first witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made .
 But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted .
 Buaford Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart av. , a CTA bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st street and South Park way .
 Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee .
 His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck .
 Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High school , 30th street and South Park way , and began "skylarking"  .
 When 51st street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor .
 As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down .
 Then the youths fled with his money .
 Mrs. Blanche Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members , John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier .
 She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office .
 Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 .
 It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place .
 The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20 .
 The defendant , William L. Stickney III 23 , of 3211 Park pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month .
 Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green Bay rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of which his father , William L. Jr. , is president .
 Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart avenue at Central street .
 At Jenks street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks .
 The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue , and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie .
 NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration .
 They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .
 And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons .
 The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey , though of Kentucky origin , is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South .
 The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North .
 The race problem has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive .
 It is these other differences between North and South  --  other , that is , than those which concern discrimination or social welfare  --  which I chiefly discuss herein .
 I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .
 A Southerner married to a New Englander , I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists , writers , publicity men , and business executives of egghead tastes .
 Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .
 This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism , because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson , who held that the best government was the least government .
 Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints .
 When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy , I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things do n't count any more in the world of to-day .
 I am naive , they say , to make use of such words .
 I take this to mean that the intelligent  --  and therefore necessarily cynical ?
  --  liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it .
 This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which , under a President of the same stamp , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court .
 As for states' rights , they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms .
 The American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one .
 Why , in the first place , call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody ?
 If he attaches little importance to personal liberty , why not make this known to the world ?
 And if he is so scornful of the rights of states , why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support ?
 I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South .
 It appears to be one of intense dislike , which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends .
 His assumption seems to be that any such friends , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views .
 Time's editor , Thomas Griffith , in his book , The Waist-High Culture , wrote : "... most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to ..."  .
 This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement .
 Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism .
 I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North .
 In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found .
 But in our case  --  and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts  --  the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more .
 In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down .
 Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view .
 But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings .
 From my wife's experience and other sources , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles .
 The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South , especially among those who studied in the North .
 And social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy , if not sympathy , toward resident and visiting Northerners .
 Also , among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems .
 There are of course many Souths ; but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who have n't .
 My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War .
 Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category .
 I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe .
 I never heard of a poll being taken on the question .
 No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic .
 Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy .
 Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South .
 Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones .
 Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia , North Carolina , and Alabama following along after them .
 Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new , but with , of course , important minority enclaves .
 The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater .
 Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence .
 The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area .
 In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South .
 Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation , the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country .
 And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown .
 Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors .
 All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did .
 Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties .
 But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South  --  to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith  --  finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North .
 And this , in effect , means most of modern America .
 It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise .
 And therein , I feel , many Northerners delude themselves about the South .
 For one thing , this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed .
 There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it .
 I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : do n't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves .
 Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past , and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream , like everybody else .
 If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .
 The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world .
 Regardless of rights and wrongs , a population and an area appropriate to a pre-World-War-I great power have been , following conquest , ruled against their will by a neighboring people , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike .
 And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .
 This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .
 The fact is due mainly to international wars , both hot and cold .
 In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country .
 So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty , the Spanish War , the two World Wars , and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion .
 And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism .
 Had the situation been reversed , had , for instance , England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England , there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain .
 It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have .
 The North should thank its stars that such has been the case ; but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom .
 The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries .
 There is much truth in both these charges , and not many Bourbons deny them .
 Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .
 Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure .
 Many Northeners believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .
 The Bourbon economic philosophy , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives .
 But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .
 They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America .
 As it is , they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism , that in spite of its high standard of living the "American way"  has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways , although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter .
 The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .
 Their own easier , slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .
 In the past , the duties of the state , as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security .
 By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders .
 Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the "inferior"  peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance .
 It became the sole "subject"  of "international law"  ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena .
 That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .
 Speaking generally , it furthered  --  and still tends to further  --  the interests of the Western powers .
 The enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era .
 Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .
 This was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .
 That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman .
 His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated .
 Thus , to cite but one example , the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e.g. , the United States ) may have incidentally benefited .
 At the same time , all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted .
 Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century .
 However , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity .
 A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .
 Already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters .
 A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner .
 In what has aptly been called a "constitutional revolution"  , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the "night-watchman state"  ) to one with affirmative duties to perform .
 The "positive state"  came into existence .
 For lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation  --  the manner in which its decisions altered in "the switch in time that saved nine"  , President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious "Court-packing plan"  , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation .
 Of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people .
 Labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms , and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom .
 A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary .
 Ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952 , the Positive State is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be .
 The general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e. , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history .
 The other , of course , was the Civil War , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation .
 A third , one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs .
 Internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented .
 Nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example  --  that of employment  --  for , as will be shown below , it cuts across both facets of the new concept .
 Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow "natural forces"  to operate and cure the distress .
 That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment .
 Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning  --  the economic side of the constitutional revolution .
 In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a "state's-responsibility"  proposal  --  provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus .
 The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 .
 Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution .
 Reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era .
 National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations .
 A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959 .
 Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties .
 It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .
 The Rule of Law , historically a principle according everyone his "day in court"  before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare .
 Recognizing that the Rule of Law is "a dynamic concept ... which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society"  , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility "to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized"  .
 The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world .
 For better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .
 Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish .
 The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition .
 The content is not the same , however : rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an "ideological group"   --  those in the "free world"   --  that is basic .
 External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations .
 If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .
 Reference to two other concepts  --  nationalism and sovereignty  --  may help to reveal the contours of the new principle .
 In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself  --  internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church .
 The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .
 Since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging .
 The concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure .
 But it is more than that .
 For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit .
 Today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world .
 Almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application  --  unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm .
 Historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group .
 By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to some degree at least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty .
 Within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied .
 While the pattern is uneven , some having gained more than others , nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well .
 Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions .
 It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ) .
 But it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet .
 In other words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population ; it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis .
 Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty .
 The former receives its legitimacy from the latter .
 Operating side by side , together they helped shore up the nation-state .
 While sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern .
 Jean Bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood .
 Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking .
 To him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law  --  i.e. , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations .
 These fundamental ideas  --  the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects  --  still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .
 The nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control .
 In fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .
 High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision .
 That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which "popular"  sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .
 Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern world .
 Is there a different reality behind the facade ?
 Does the surface hide a quite different picture ?
 The short answer to those questions is "yes"  .
 Both concepts are undergoing alteration ; to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility .
 As evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances .
 Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ?
 What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ?
 Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ?
 Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ?
 Will the danger increase or decrease ?
 I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White House , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as "Sherwood Forest"  .
 I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the "commit buttons"  that could start a war  --  accidentally or by design  --  and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons .
 To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched .
 There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate .
 "Readiness exercises"  are almost continuous .
 Each could be the real thing .
 In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since "E hour"  .
 "E"  stands for "execution"   --  the moment a "go order"  would unleash an American nuclear strike .
 There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks .
 They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines .
 They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details .
 Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks .
 Among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their "hardware"  , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call "scenarios"  .
 As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : "You ca n't have dry runs on this one"  .
 The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will  --  but possibly might .
 Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : The more highly placed they are  --  that is , the more they know  --  the more concerned they have become .
 Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .
 Only recently new "holes"  were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more .
 Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons .
 Meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by "false pre-emption"  , "escalation"  , "unauthorized behavior"  and other terms that will be discussed in this report .
 They inhabit a secret world centered on "go codes"  and "gold phones"  .
 Their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures  --  arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .
 One arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm "theirs"  .
 Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me  --  and the experts .
 These men are not callous .
 It is their job to think about the unthinkable .
 Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us  --  and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too  --  thought about accidental war .
 The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle , a frail , meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist .
 He was , and is , with the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U. S. Air Force .
 His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased .
 In recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration , basic United States strategy has been modified  --  and large new sums allocated  --  to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .
 The chain starts at BMEWS ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule , Greenland .
 Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States .
 BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD ( North American Air Defense Command ) in Colorado Springs , Colorado , for interpretation ; to the SAC command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base , near Omaha , Nebraska ; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President .
 Telephones , Teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points .
 Alternate locations exist for all key command centers .
 For last-ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command posts on KC-135 jet tankers .
 Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .
 The same principle of "redundancy"  applies to all communications on these special networks .
 And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources .
 Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications .
 Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons .
 That's the law .
 But what if somebody decides to break it ?
 The President can not personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger .
 He makes the momentous decision .
 Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons .
 What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the Russians ?
 What if the President himself , in the language of the military , "goes ape"  ?
 Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation ?
 Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers .
 However , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war .
 Even the President can not pick up his telephone and give a "go"  order .
 Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike  --  the "go code"  .
 In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the "gold-phone circuit"  .
 A system of "gold"   --  actually yellow  --  phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the SAC commander and other key men .
 All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes .
 All could help the President make his decision .
 The talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble .
 Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda .
 Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from BMEWS .
 If communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order .
 For these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .
 They include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk , Virginia , which is in contact with the Polaris subs ; NATO headquarters in Europe ; Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; and SAC , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles .
 Let us look in on one of these nerve centers  --  SAC at Omaha  --  and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their H-bombs .
 In a word , plenty .
 The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman , SAC's senior controller .
 He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day .
 It is a quiet but impressive room  --  140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high .
 Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information .
 And Bill Wisman , forty-three , a farmer's son from Beallsville , Ohio , is a quiet but impressive man .
 His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown .
 His movements and speech are precise , clear and quick .
 No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .
 Wisman , who has had the chief controller's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons .
 At least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him .
 In front of him is a gold phone .
 In emergencies the SAC commander , Gen. Thomas Powern , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff .
 At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .
 General Power would participate in the decision making .
 Wisman , below , would listen in and act .
 His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft .
 He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked ALERT .
 There are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged .
 But Wisman , too , does not know the go code .
 He must take it from "the red box"  .
 In point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right .
 The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( "It's real obnoxious"  ) .
 Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets .
 The codes in the red box  --  there are several of them covering various contingencies  --  are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof "unique device"  .
 They are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff , at random intervals .
 But even the contents of Wisman's box can not start a war .
 They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages .
 What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed .
 The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff .
 In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an "internal authenticator"  , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing .
 I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one .
 "I'd wind up full of .38 bullet holes"  , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .
 Now let us imagine a wing of B-52's , on alert near their "positive control ( or fail-safe ) points"  , the spots on the map , many miles from Soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets .
 They , too , have fragments of the go code with them .
 As Wisman put it , "They have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie . Once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it . Unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing"  .
 .
 Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ?
 The answer is a cryptographic secret .
 At any rate , three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message .
 Each must match Wisman's "pie"  with the fragment that he carries with him .
 All three must compare notes and agree to "go"  .
 After that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released .
 Unless all gadgets are properly operated  --  and the wires and seals from the handles removed first  --  no damage can be done .
 Suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended .
 They went as rigid as black statuary ... six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still .
 Their heads were in the air sniffing .
 They all swung at the same instant in the same direction .
 They saw it before I did , even with my binoculars .
 It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth .
 In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .
 A white man would not have seen it .
 The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos .
 Watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land .
 At once the whole band set off at a lope .
 They were chasing a rain cloud .
 They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow .
 I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care .
 The games were over , this was life .
 Occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot .
 Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .
 Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley .
 Their gait is impossible to convey in words .
 It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .
 It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful .
 It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground .
 They ran for three hours .
 Finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall .
 For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for the first time , shouting and capering .
 Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady .
 They were studying the ground .
 Suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .
 He had found a depression with rain water in it .
 He bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground .
 With a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .
 The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle .
 In an instant he had sucked it dry .
 The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen .
 Which does not mean that it is ugly .
 Part of it is , of course .
 There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous .
 They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand .
 Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality .
 But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable .
 It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .
 The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean .
 He tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer .
 They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the "outback"  country .
 "The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps . Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men . Only there happened  --  nothing . There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only  --  there was not . It might have rained , any time ; only  --  it did not . There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; only  --  there was not . They lay , with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them . No one came"  .
 .
 The white men died .
 And countless others like them have died .
 Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .
 The aborigine is not deceived ; he knows that the land is hard and pitiless .
 He knows that the economy of life in the "outback"  is awful .
 There is no room for error or waste .
 Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done .
 I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but I suspect that it can .
 Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity .
 SEEING an aborigine today is a difficult thing .
 Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports .
 Others are confined to vast reservations , and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch  --  which is very low indeed .
 I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived "outback"  for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .
 It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation , even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language .
 Finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover .
 We followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth .
 The rancher went a mile down this road and then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road .
 At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel .
 It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass welded to it , which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about .
 The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland .
 "Do you always navigate like this"  ?
 I asked .
 "Damned right"  , he said .
 "Once I get out on the flat I do . Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks ... a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there . But if you do n't know the place like the palm of your hand , you'd better use a compass and the speedometer . Two miles northeast , then five miles southwest ... that sort of thing . Very simple"  .
 .
 He was right .
 The landscape kept repeating itself .
 I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless .
 Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines .
 They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children .
 The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder .
 There was also a dog , a dingo dog .
 Its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches .
 It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully .
 It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog .
 No one patted the dog .
 It was not a pet .
 It was a worker .
 "The buggers love shade"  , the rancher said .
 "I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water . They'll move around that rock all day , following the shade . During the hottest part of the day , of course , the sun comes straight down and there is n't any shade"  .
 .
 We drove close to the boulder , stopped the Land Rover , and walked over toward the family .
 The man was leaning against the rock .
 He gazed away from us as we approached .
 He was over six feet tall and very thin .
 His legs were narrow and very long .
 Every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving .
 He had long black hair and a wispy beard .
 The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .
 There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .
 It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .
 A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink .
 The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .
 I turned to look at the lubra .
 She remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there ; like the man , she was entirely naked .
 Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her .
 There were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent .
 There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy .
 There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .
 Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless .
 The two children , both boys , wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work .
 They squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a few inches from the ground .
 They had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at a time , and pinched them dead .
 The tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple .
 The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines .
 The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant .
 It was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed .
 One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant .
 But that is a cliche and a dishonest one .
 The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it .
 Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin .
 They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it .
 In spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ; as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic .
 The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .
 "That smell is something , eh , mate"  ?
 the Australian asked .
 "They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other . At the corroborees , when they get to dancing and sweating , you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell . Idje , here"  .
 , and he nodded at the man , "is said to have great odor . The stink is all the same to me , but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded"  .
 .
 "Here , Idje , you fella like tabac"  ?
 he said sharply .
 Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon .
 The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest .
 It was a fortunate time in which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art .
 The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city .
 Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes .
 At the heart of all of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be "as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe"  .
 In time Isfahan came to be known as "half the world"  , Isfahan nisf-i-jahan .
 In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline .
 The Afghans invaded ; the Safavids fell from power ; the capital went elsewhere ; the desert encroached .
 Isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East .
 They think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor .
 Those who actually get there find that it is n't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight .
 But even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead .
 Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present .
 It seems that for Persia , and especially for this city , there are only two times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present .
 The one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called "historical monuments"  .
 However , just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared .
 The values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes .
 Often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply "historical monuments"  ; they are the places where Persians live .
 The promenade , for example , continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street .
 It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square .
 On Fridays , the day when many Persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into Chehel Sotun  --  a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas II in the seventeenth century  --  but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former .
 And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life  --  very much a social institution  --  in the bazaar .
 Those three other great activities of the Persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture : long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches .
 But more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities .
 Water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form  --  these things are important to Persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .
 I should like , by the way , to make it clear that I am not using the word "Persians"  carelessly .
 I do n't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool .
 These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary .
 The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .
 A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor .
 Not long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks .
 The air , he said , was just right ; a cigarette would taste particularly good .
 I really did n't know what he meant .
 It was a nice day , granted .
 But he knew ; he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .
 The natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the most ordinary of Persians a great deal of attention .
 The line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from Hafiz , the purity of spring water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion  --  these things are noticed , judged , and valued .
 Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge .
 There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city .
 For one thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in .
 It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that Shah Abbas II in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge .
 It is a splendid structure .
 From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; from downstream , where the water level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion .
 The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile .
 At either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses .
 Here , in the old days  --  when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks  --  sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between .
 Below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge .
 These are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .
 Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .
 Here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults .
 On the downstream , or "pavilion"  , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself .
 From the terraces  --  eighteen in all  --  broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river .
 Out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more than just a bridge .
 On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge .
 It is a great spectacle .
 The bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera .
 Crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege .
 All kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ; students , civil servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns .
 Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar .
 Below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river .
 Above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance .
 Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face .
 To a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people .
 Many of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant .
 Nonetheless , they take time out  --  much time  --  from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks .
 Above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .
 Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which  --  in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms  --  all may stand .
 It contains , in fact , their whole outlook on life .
 And it is expressed , at least to their taste , in a perfect form .
 Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty .
 In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums .
 In Persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for that matter , hardly any books , the twins run free .
 It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .
 That , at any rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge .
 Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .
 Here in these little rooms  --  or stages arched open to the sky and river  --  they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided .
 Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute  --  one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .
 The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; for example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : "They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains ; Go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes , and he was one"  .
 Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : "Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies . In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred ..."  .
 .
 These songs ( practically all Persian music , for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves .
 Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque .
 Die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .
 The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , William Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical organization , which is his life .
 When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months , "commuting"  between the two cities .
 This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg .
 His London contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face , "I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts"  !
 Our meeting took place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York , before he left for Europe .
 As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent .
 Seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned off .
 Unfortunately , it was Muzak , which automatically is piped into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured .
 As he talked about himself , time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled .
 Did he come from a musical family ?
 Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .
 In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet .
 She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values .
 When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale .
 Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies .
 When he was eight he began violin lessons .
 Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra , and during World War I , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .
 Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career .
 "By observing the conductor"  , he says with a twinkle in his eyes , "I learned how not to conduct"  .
 The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium .
 Simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as well in the violin and piano .
 His professional career began when he was twenty ; he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor .
 Was n't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post ?
 Yes , the Maestro assented .
 Had he always wished to be a conductor ?
 No , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such .
 However , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist .
 Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera , after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky , teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold .
 In 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague .
 During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera .
 Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime .
 During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany .
 He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and de Falla's La Vida Breve .
 The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber , and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen .
 At the outset of his career , Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year .
 In Frankfurt , too , he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which , in addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony .
 Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's , Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community .
 Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann .
 As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities .
 In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund .
 In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra  --  now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra  --  with Steinberg as founder-conductor .
 In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland .
 After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor , at Toscanini's invitation , of the NBC Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America .
 In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic .
 Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony .
 Since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi's Falstaff .
 In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe , conducting in Italy , France , Austria , and Switzerland .
 He returned to Germany for the first time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in Cologne , Frankfurt , and Berlin .
 Where in Europe was he going now ?
 First of all , to Italy for a short vacation  --  Forte dei Marmi , a place he loves .
 Since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces .
 Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : "Rome is my second home . I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year"  .
 .
 He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia , as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne .
 "Then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia"  , he added .
 The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest .
 There will be premieres of new works , made possible through Ford Foundation commissions : Carlisle Floyd's Mystery , with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist .
 Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante .
 "And next year we will do  --  also a Ford commission  --  a piano concerto by Elliott Carter , with Jacob Lateiner as soloist . Of course , I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season , as usual . We'll play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the original version , and Mahler's Seventh  --  the least accessible , known , and played of Mahler's works . My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner"  .
 .
 He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour , especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies , and Das Lied von der Erde , and Bruckner's Sixth  --  which is rarely played  --  and Seventh .
 Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as "my travel symphony"  .
 He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for "still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans"  , the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation .
 "Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us , I am probably the only one  --  with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein  --  who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler"  .
 Since he introduces so much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it .
 "There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created . But I usually stick to the old phrase : Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion ) . I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today"  .
 .
 With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else ?
 He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals .
 He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago .
 And how did he feel about modern art ?
 Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments .
 "As my wife puts it"  , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes , "all you know is your music . But after all , you never learned anything else"  .
 !
 What did he do for relaxation ?
 Like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery stories , in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
 He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature .
 But his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family  --  his wife , daughter and son .
 At the moment he was excited about his son's having received the Prix de Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb .
 "Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment"  .
 "IS the attitude of German youth comparable to that of the angry young men of England"  ?
 was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich .
 I was chairman , the only not youthful participant .
 Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry .
 I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly .
 "It is easy for you to talk"  ; countered a twenty year old law student , "you travel around the world . We would like to do that too"  .
 .
 "But you want a job guaranteed when you return"  , I continued my attack .
 "You must have some security"  , said a young clerk .
 When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .
 One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds .
 "Would you advise us to act the same way ?
 You might have failed . I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck"  .
 .
 Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding .
 The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears .
 Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
 What they wished for most was security ; what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country .
 The ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting of husband , wife , and two children .
 No one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory .
 All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest .
 ONCE again , as in the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test .
 That test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine "whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure"  .
 It is well then that in this hour both of "national peril"  and of "national opportunity"  we can take counsel with the men who made the nation .
 Incapable of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty .
 Seven Founders  --  George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , Alexander Hamilton , James Madison and John Jay  --  determined the destinies of the new nation .
 In certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way .
 As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 , "We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us . Our successors will have an easier task"  .
 .
 They thought of themselves , to use Jefferson's words , as "the Argonauts"  who had lived in "the Heroic Age"  .
 Accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity .
 Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that "with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved"  .
 Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .
 Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation .
 Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary .
 Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years .
 Eldest of the seven , Benjamin Franklin , a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia , wrote the most dazzling success story in our history .
 The young printer's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman .
 Author of the Albany Plan of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention .
 ON a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian War , then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia .
 Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory .
 Retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon , he returned to preside over the Federal Convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President .
 During his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed .
 John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts , negotiated , with Franklin and Jay , the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President .
 HIS political opponent and lifetime friend , Thomas Jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first term as President .
 During the greater part of Jefferson's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian , James Madison , eight years his junior .
 The active sponsor of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia , Madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia , founded the first political party in American history , and , as Jefferson's Secretary of State and his successor in the Presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain .
 If Franklin was an authentic genius , then Alexander Hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy .
 His revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders .
 Principal author of "The Federalist"  , he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly .
 His collaboration with Washington , begun when he was the general's aide during the Revolution , was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury .
 His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions .
 LESS dazzling than Hamilton , less eloquent than Jefferson , John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers .
 He served as president of the Continental Congress .
 He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period .
 As first Chief Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall .
 He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York .
 These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed .
 Their social status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with Washington , Jefferson and Jay ; in others by business and professional acumen , as with Franklin and Adams , or , in Hamilton's case , by an influential marriage .
 Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started .
 As different physically as the tall , angular Jefferson was from the chubby , rotund Adams , the seven were striking individualists .
 Ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking .
 capable of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens .
 John Adams dismissed John Dickinson , who voted against the Declaration of Independence , as "a certain great fortune and piddling genius"  .
 Washington castigated his critic , General Conway , as being capable of "all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity"  .
 And Hamilton , who felt it "a religious duty"  to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint .
 The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service .
 Madison once remarked : "My life has been so much a public one"  , a comment which fits the careers of the other six .
 Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests .
 Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management .
 He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation .
 John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , Jeremiah Gridley , to "pursue the study of the law , rather than the gain of it"  .
 In taking account of seventeen years of law practice , Adams concluded that "no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did"  and "for so little profit"  .
 When the Revolution broke out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .
 Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet .
 While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .
 "If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars"  , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury .
 To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service .
 Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party .
 Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle .
 The Frenchman was astonished .
 "I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in order to support his family"  , he reflected .
 ALL seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality .
 John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters , the British Constitution and the common law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence "to the tribunal of the world"  for support of a revolution justified by "the laws of nature and of nature's God"  .
 They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783 .
 This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee , Peter Van Schaack .
 Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack .
 Yet when , at war's end , the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence , Jay wrote him from Paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement : "As an independent American I considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack"  .
 The latter in turn assured him that "were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause"  .
 All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation .
 "We have now a national character to establish"  , Washington wrote in 1783 .
 "Think continentally"  , Hamilton counseled the young nation .
 This new force , love of country , super-imposed upon  --  if not displacing  --  affectionate ties to one's own state , was epitomized by Washington .
 His first inaugural address speaks of "my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love"  .
 All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers .
 Save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution .
 They supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable .
 Historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government , with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position .
 THE state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians .
 In purchasing Louisiana , Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution , and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff .
 Indeed , the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats .
 WHEN , in 1832 , the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve , they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman .
 In his political testament , "Advice to My Country"  , penned just before his death , Madison expressed the wish "that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated . Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened ; and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise"  .
 .

 LONG LIVE TOBACCO ROAD .
 Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop .
 Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South  --  an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers .
 Indeed , it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live  --  but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .
 Those writers known collectively as the "Southern school"  have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; according to many critics , in fact , the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War , both quantitatively and qualitatively .
 Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .
 It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century .
 This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification .
 But the South is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .
 In 1900 the South was only 15% urban ; in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban .
 In a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status .
 There is a New South emerging , a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche  --  especially within recent decades .
 As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North  --  a tendency which Willard Thorp terms "Yankeefication"  , as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte , Birmingham , and Houston .
 It is said that , even at the present stage of Southern urbanization , such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton .
 Undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind : William Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder , a Civil War general , now renamed , in typical California fashion , "Buena Vista Terrace"  .
 The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force .
 As for progress , the "backward South"  can boast of Baton Rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126,000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000 .
 The field , then , is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the Southern Yankeefication : the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems ; the list is , obviously , endless .
 But these sources have not been tapped .
 Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism , exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as  --  or even more unreal than  --  yesterday .
 William Styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes .
 Even the great god Faulkner , the South's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ; such are simply not within his bounded province .
 Where are the writers to treat these changes ?
 Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ?
 Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades .
 Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money .
 An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865 .
 Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma has n't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .
 The Negro faces as much , if not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one .
 This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .
 But there have been abrupt changes as well : the sit-ins , the picket lines , the bus strikes  --  all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago .
 Today's evidence , such as the fact that only three Southern states ( South Carolina , Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness .
 Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the busses ; his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools  --  changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954 .
 Then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ; only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change .
 Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion .
 He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .
 This bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence .
 A new order is thrusting itself into being .
 A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man .
 The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction .
 It is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters "yassuhs"  and "sho' nufs"  with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in Old South terms , "massuh"  ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester .
 While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .
 Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type .
 Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .
 Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life , it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature .
 The book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; recently only Keith Wheeler's novel , Peaceable Lane , has openly faced the problem .
 All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .
 Many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this "gracious Old South"  imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's "Tara"  plantation .
 Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .
 Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead .
 As John T. Westbrook says in his article , "Twilight of Southern Regionalism"  ( Southwest Review , Winter 1957 ) : "... The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with"  .
 Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees : "Our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence [ of urbanization ] presented to his senses . It bewilders and befuddles him . He is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren . The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders . On this trip to the South he wants , above all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight"  .
 .
 Obviously , such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe .
 In the meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress .
 Willard Thorp , in his new book American Writing in the Twentieth Century , observes , quite validly it seems : "... Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched . No southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York ... There are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south"  .
 .
 Not a single Southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material .
 Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard .
 Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done .
 He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably .
 He treats it with a mythological , universal application .
 As his disciples boast , even though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families .
 Even two decades ago in Go Down , Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil .
 Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
 Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way .
 Thus Faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the "new"  South has gradually evolved out of the Old South , and consequently its agrarian roots persist .
 Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization .
 With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil .
 The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas .
 Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre .
 Most avant-garde creators , true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting .
 But Robert Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them .
 He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace , so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity .
 For Mr. Taylor's Images and Reflections he made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl's cape lined with grass .
 Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor .
 In fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound .
 To raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit .
 He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be .
 He went on to use objects  --  hoops , poles , capes  --  which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them .
 The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .
 In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .
 The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself .
 Or , clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a "finial"  .
 As the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give birth to a new being .
 From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit .
 Thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition .
 But , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal ?
 Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work .
 Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician .
 An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse : "one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception"  .
 The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience .
 He disdains external restrictions  --  conventional syntax , traditional metre .
 The unit of form is determined subjectively : "the Heart , by the way of the Breath , to the Line"  .
 The test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters .
 An earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious .
 The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order .
 The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .
 He is still concerned , however , with a personal event .
 He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation .
 The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .
 Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth .
 Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world .
 The concept remains subjective .
 But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight , rather than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work .
 Others look to more objective devices of order .
 The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set in motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities .
 The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ) .
 He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .
 But he can not order his elements by will , either rational or inspired .
 The system works as an impersonal mechanism .
 Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .
 Again , the composer must select his own materials .
 But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .
 Avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned to similar approaches .
 Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation .
 According to Katherine Litz , "the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance"  .
 The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .
 The sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; or it may involve more subtle distinctions : the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head .
 Even the least alteration will change the quality .
 An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance .
 The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for Miss Litz , or spontaneous , as it is for Merle Marsicano .
 She , too , is concerned with "the becoming , the process of realization"  , but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns .
 The design is determined emotionally : "I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me"  .
 Looking back , Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock .
 At one time she felt impelled to make dances that "moved all over the stage"  , much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas .
 But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself .
 Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement .
 It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground .
 This became a dance called Prelude to Flight .
 A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus .
 Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion .
 He seeks to make his dancers more "godlike"  by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light color , and sound .
 If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars , this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities .
 It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered .
 In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the "first revealed stroke of its existence"  , states the theme from which all else must follow .
 The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve .
 It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions .
 It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs .
 Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their "motional content"  .
 Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .
 But the metamorphosis must come first .
 Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim .
 He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect .
 He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything .
 An order can be chanced rather than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is "free and discovered rather than bound and remembered"  .
 Thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .
 Chance , he finds , enables him to create "a world beyond imagination"  .
 He cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert : "Why , it's extremely interesting . But I would never have thought of it myself"  .
 .
 The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life .
 At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella .
 A man and a girl happen to meet ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other .
 He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened .
 If one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon .
 Events occur without apparent reason .
 Their consequences are irrelevant  --  or there are no consequences at all .
 The sequence is determined by chance , and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices .
 He may toss coins ; he may take slips of paper from a grab bag .
 The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed .
 The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance .
 The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance .
 The "approximate"  is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable .
 Each performance may be different .
 If a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance .
 And any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether .
 Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ; he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can .
 However , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute .
 Then the choreographer must arbitrate .
 He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other .
 He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap .
 THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers .
 The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee .
 The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in love of their Union .
 Repeated efforts  --  beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821  --  were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .
 Even so , confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century .
 Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty .
 The present issue in Atlantica  --  whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens  --  resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War .
 And so I would only touch upon it now ( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it ) .
 I think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861  --  if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject .
 The difference came down to this : The Southern States insisted that the United States was , in last analysis , what its name implied  --  a Union of States .
 To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from it .
 This right of the State , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government .
 The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of America , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could .
 Writing to Speed on August 24 , 1855 , Lincoln made the latter point clear .
 In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede .
 "We began by declaring that all men are created equal . We now practically read it , all men are created equal except negroes . When the Know-nothings get control , it will read , All men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and Catholics . When it comes to this , I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty  --  to Russia , for instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy"  .
 .
 [ His emphasis ] When the Southern States exercised their "right to secede"  , they formed what they officially styled "The Confederate States of America"  .
 Dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy .
 The fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did .
 The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim , and most of the rest in substance .
 It operated on , by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution .
 It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches .
 Many believe  --  and understandably  --  that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede .
 But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11  --  nearly a month before hostilities began  --  included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede .
 Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution .
 Their President , Jefferson Davis , interpreted their Constitution to mean that it "admits of no coerced association"  , but this reremained so doubtful that "there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution"  .
 The Constitution of the Southern "Confederation"  differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery  --  an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution .
 They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that "all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ..."  .
 The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .
 These are not , however , differences in federal structure .
 The only important differences from that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies in their Preambles .
 The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .
 Here are the two Preambles : "we the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America"  .
 "We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  --  invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God  --  do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America"  .
 One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought .
 But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states .
 If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union .
 Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one : Whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to "anarchy or despotism"  .
 Much as he abhorred slavery , Lincoln was always willing to concede to each "slave state"  the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it .
 Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states .
 After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union .
 He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union .
 In his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words  --  which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union : "In giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free"  .
 What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union .
 He fought to the end to preserve it as a "government of the people , by the people , for the people"  .
 The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery  --  the antithesis of individual liberty  --  made the conflict grimmer , and the greater .
 Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in the North , as America's true sovereign , in "a new birth of freedom"  , as Lincoln promised .
 But before this came about , 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states .
 On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the "brave men , living and dead , who fought here"  .
 He understood that both sides were at fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural .
 To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly  --  to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .
 So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see  --  any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend .
 It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union .
 They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen  --  but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : That individual life , liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two  --  and on the limitation of sovereignty , in all its aspects , which this involves .
 The 140,414 Americans who gave "the last full measure of devotion"  to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people .
 But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways .
 Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves  --  a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .
 The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure .
 There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another .
 There was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep Americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet .
 Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for .
 The lives so many of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe .
 As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new "unnatural"  and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .
 The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments .
 One wonders about its applicability to people .
 Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction ?
 The answer is of course yes .
 For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .
 Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .
 But it has been during the last two centuries , during the scientific revolution , that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides .
 We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air , although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance .
 At what stage are social sciences then ?
 Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton ?
 There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud .
 And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .
 Political theoretical understanding , although almost at a standstill during this century , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man .
 Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .
 Most of these , with horrible exceptions , were conceived as is a ship , not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind , nor to deny its force , but as a means to survive and enjoy it .
 The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme .
 Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics , so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding .
 We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .
 In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other .
 I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .
 There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .
 Lucretius has remarked : "The reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause , and these they attribute to the will of God"  .
 Perhaps things were even worse then .
 It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man .
 We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was .
 We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets .
 The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage .
 We are worried about what people may do with them  --  that some crazy fool may "push the button"  .
 I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears , but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly .
 They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .
 They include both individual fears and collective ones .
 They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .
 Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but , because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding , one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective , and the whole pattern becomes ritualized .
 Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .
 To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition .
 But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating .
 The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize .
 It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .
 This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions .
 This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .
 In fact , although we have dispelled the fear , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers .
 There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision .
 A meteor could fall on San Francisco .
 Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .
 Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which , in this case , amounts to doing nothing .
 Yet we no longer feel uneasy .
 This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war .
 We , in our country , think of war as an external threat which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .
 And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave .
 What elements of our behavior are decisive ?
 Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ?
 We have staved off a war and , since our behavior has involved all these elements , we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it , since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective .
 I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city .
 If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .
 With the group of boys it is different .
 He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side .
 When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .
 I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics .
 I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose .
 Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise .
 We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements .
 Our collective policies , group and national , are similarly based on voodoo , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them .
 We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as "trust"  , "cheat"  , and "get tough"  .
 We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles .
 We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect .
 Small wonder , then , that we fear .
 The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago .
 What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played ?
 In the physical sciences , these achievements concern electricity , chemistry , and atomic physics .
 In the life sciences , there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease , in the mechanisms of heredity , and in bio-and physiological chemistry .
 The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment .
 In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .
 Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking , but where some explanations are possible , as with lightning and weather and earthquakes , the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated .
 Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears .
 How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study .
 In some areas , the progress is slower than in others .
 In agriculture , for example , despite the advances in biology , elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster .
 In child care , the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory .
 There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .
 Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared .
 The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .
 In fact , the recent warnings about the use of X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding , and thus in this instance , science has momentarily aggravated our fears .
 In fact , insofar as science generates any fear , it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty .
 Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .
 The situation with regard to our attitude and "control"  of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people .
 The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe .
 Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour .
 His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .
 He was waiting .
 My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work .
 American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic .
 They find deep pessimism in them .
 Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that "Waiting for Godot"  is "the concentrate ... of the contemporary European ... mood of despair"  .
 But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .
 Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me ?
 Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ?
 Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves ?
 I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions , because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis , the questions had to be settled by the work itself .
 Nevertheless I was curious .
 My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature , a Jesuit father , at a conference on religious drama near Paris .
 When Beckett's name came into the discussion , the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett "hates life"  .
 That , I thought , is at least one thing I can find out when we meet .
 Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish .
 The features of his face are distinct , but not fine .
 They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel .
 Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle .
 One might say it combines the man's own pride and humility .
 For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility , perhaps of the same genesis , not to impose himself upon another .
 His light blue eyes , set deep within the face , are actively and continually looking .
 He seems , by some unconscious division of labor , to have given them that one function and no other , leaving communication to the rest of the face .
 The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile .
 The voice is light in timbre , with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage .
 The Irish accent is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections from the French .
 His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green .
 He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie .
 We walked down the Rue de L' Arcade , thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church .
 The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering .
 For one thing , the world that Beckett sees is already shattered .
 His talk turns to what he calls "the mess"  , or sometimes "this buzzing confusion"  .
 I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation .
 What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words .
 "The confusion is not my invention . We can not listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion . It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in . The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess . It is not a mess you can make sense of"  .
 .
 I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth , but Beckett did not take to the word truth .
 "What is more true than anything else ?
 To swim is true , and to sink is true . One is not more true than the other . One can not speak anymore of being , one must speak only of the mess . When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence , they may be right , I do n't know , but their language is too philosophical for me . I am not a philosopher . One can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess"  .
 .
 Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form .
 Until recently , art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things .
 It has held them at bay .
 It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form .
 "How could the mess be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be"  ?
 But now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time when "it invades our experience at every moment . It is there and it must be allowed in"  .
 .
 I granted this might be so , but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously .
 And why not ?
 How , I asked , could chaos be admitted to chaos ?
 Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art ?
 If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form .
 Beckett's own work is an example .
 Plays more highly formalized than "Waiting for Godot"  , "Endgame"  , and "Krapp's Last Tape"  would be hard to find .
 "What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art . It only means that there will be new form , and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else . The form and the chaos remain separate . The latter is not reduced to the former . That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation , because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates . To find a form that accommodates the mess , that is the task of the artist now"  .
 .
 Yet , I responded , could not similar things be said about the art of the past ?
 Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we can not clarify , demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way ?
 What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory ?
 Is n't all art ambiguous ?
 "Not this"  , he said , and gestured toward the Madeleine .
 The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory , dominated all the scene where we sat .
 The Boulevard de la Madeleine , the Boulevard Malesherbes , and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery , bearing tidings of the Age of Reason .
 "Not this . This is clear . This does not allow the mystery to invade us . With classical art , all is settled . But it is different at Chartres . There is the unexplainable , and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer"  .
 .
 I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays .
 Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside .
 Is this life-death question a part of the chaos ?
 "Yes . If life and death did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability . If there were only darkness , all would be clear . It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable . Take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology ?
 Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned . How can we make sense of this division ?
 In classical drama , such problems do not arise . The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark . As she goes , she herself will be illuminated . At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark . That is the play . Within this notion clarity is possible , but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity . The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary  --  total salvation . But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable . The key word in my plays is perhaps"  .
 .
 Given a theological lead , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays .
 "Well , really there is none at all . I have no religious feeling . Once I had a religious emotion . It was at my first Communion . No more . My mother was deeply religious . So was my brother . He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel . My father had none . The family was Protestant , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go . My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died . At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school tie . Irish Catholicism is not attractive , but it is deeper . When you pass a church on an Irish bus , all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross . One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs"  .
 .
 But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with ?
 "Yes , for they deal with distress . Some people object to this in my writing . At a party an English intellectual  --  so-called  --  asked me why I write always about distress . As if it were perverse to do so !
 He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood . I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood . Then he thought me more perverse than ever . I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi . On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one asked for help for the blind , another help for orphans , and the third for relief for the war refugees . One does not have to look for distress . It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London"  .
 .
 Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us .
 The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays .
 He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern .
 "Perhaps"  stands in place of commitment .
 At the same time , he is plainly sympathetic , clearly friendly .
 If there were only the mess , all would be clear ; but there is also compassion .
 As a Christian , I know I do not stand where Beckett stands , but I do see much of what he sees .
 As a writer on the theater , I have paid close attention to the plays .
 Harold Clurman is right to say that "Waiting for Godot"  is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) "of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics , ethic , and common way of life"  .
 Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to .
 "Waiting for Godot"  sells even better in America than in France .
 The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America , but it is the consciousness that most "mature"  societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture .
 America is now joining Europe in this "mature"  phase of development .
 Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa , and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold .
 Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms never maintained that sex was all .
 Hemingway's fiction is supported by a "moral"  backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .
 And D. H. Lawrence , in Fantasia of the Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive .
 Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex .
 "All is not sex"  , declared Lawrence .
 Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .
 The creative urge , for example , transcends the body and the self .
 But for the beat generation all is sex .
 Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex .
 For the beatnik , like the hipster , is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct .
 He has elevated sex  --  not Eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex  --  to the rank of the godhead ; it is Astarte , Ishtar , Venus , Yahwe , Dionysus , Christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe .
 Jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse .
 Lawrence Lipton , in The Holy Barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ; it is a mystique , and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse .
 The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place .
 The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire .
 For this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .
 The beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates .
 It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy .
 They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety .
 Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of "necking"  and "petting"  .
 That is reserved for the squares .
 If they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ; it is sacred .
 As Lipton , the prophet of the beat generation , declares : "In the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power . This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat"  .
 .
 This is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond .
 If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery , Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz .
 In addition , they have been converted to Zen Buddhism , with its glorification of all that is "natural"  and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing .
 Thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to "religious"  metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .
 What they are after is the beatific vision .
 And Zen Buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release .
 The style of life chosen by the beat generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience .
 Jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect .
 Jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ; indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value .
 That is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it .
 Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction .
 Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being .
 Jazz , like sex , is a mystique .
 It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man .
 The mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living .
 Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination .
 Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; let them learn to "swing"  freely , to let go , to become authentically themselves , and then perhaps civilization will be saved .
 The beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present .
 If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil .
 He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .
 That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in .
 Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge .
 Their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation .
 The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious .
 With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .
 Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible .
 Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent .
 And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit  --  writing , painting , music .
 They are non-conformists on principle .
 When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation .
 It is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed .
 What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse .
 Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability .
 One girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .
 If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it ?
 "Most often"  , she says , "it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest"  .
 There is nothing holy in wedlock .
 This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life .
 She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous .
 This confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences .
 Boredom is death .
 In the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme .
 Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .
 One beat poet composes a poem , "Lines on a Tijuana John"  , which contains a few happy hints for survival .
 The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity .
 The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation .
 Who are the creative representatives of this movement ?
 Nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society .
 They embrace independent poverty , usually with a "shack-up"  partner who will help support them .
 They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .
 Their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .
 They feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police .
 This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these "religious"  heights .
 One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up .
 What obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk ?
 Sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth .
 Everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism .
 In his chapter on "The Loveways of the Beat Generation"  , Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details .
 No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group .
 The women who come to West Venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for the moment , in being constantly on the move .
 Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals , heroin addicts , and smalltime hoodlums .
 Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .
 Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have to be initiated .
 Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .
 As Lipton puts it : "The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms . The magic circle is , in fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm"  .
 .
 Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being .
 Carried high on this "charge"  , he composes "magical"  poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words .
 If he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work  --  Allen Ginsberg's "Howl"  is a striking example of this tendency  --  that is disoriented , Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control .
 For drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity .
 How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses .
 If love reflects the nature of man , as Ortega y Gasset believes , if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love , then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre .
 After only eighteen years of non-interference , there were already indications of melioration , though "in a slight degree"  , to be sure .
 There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century .
 I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg .
 In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .
 It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on .
 But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .
 For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .
 It's infuriating , this feeling that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .
 By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ?
 The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North , to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue , to "show the world that"  ( as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) "however bad I may be , you're not quite the people to say it"  .
 In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .
 At the present time , the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of "integration"  in the North than in the South .
 The line is a pretty good one .
 People talk about "the law of the land"  .
 The expression has become quite a cliche .
 But people ca n't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law .
 I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with "deliberate speed , majestic instancy"  ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound of Heaven's pursuit ) by judicial fiat .
 They did n't seem to be able to think of any .
 A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .
 But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation  --  the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , "They make a desert , and call it peace"  ( "Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant"  .
 .
 Moreover , the law of the land is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been , many times .
 Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter .
 Prohibition was the law of the land , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days , drinking was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast !
 ) and was repealed .
 The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .
 The Declaration of Independence says that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed"  .
 The phrase "consent of the governed"  needs a hard look .
 How do we define it ?
 Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority ?
 Calhoun dealt with this question in his "Disquisition on Government"  .
 To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of "concurrent majority"  , which , he said , "by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation"  .
 Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ?
 that regional peculiarities do not still exist ?
 that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ?
 Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of "the consent of the governed"  ?
 Circumstances alter cases .
 A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell .
 He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .
 I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's .
 One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We're-not-Involved viewpoint , It Does n't Affect Us !
 Southern Liberals ( there are a good many )  --  especially if they're rich  --  often exhibit blithe insouciance .
 The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it does n't cost you anything .
 You've already sent your daughter to Miss X's select academy for girls and your son to Mr. Y's select academy for boys , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity .
 If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England .
 New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West .
 They may even enroll a colored student or two for show , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand , or any place other than the American South .
 It would be interesting to know how much "integration"  there is in the famous , fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England .
 A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; that is , about one-half of one per cent , which looks pretty "tokenish"  to me , especially in an institution which professes to be "national"  .
 I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .
 I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children , the question of what their best interests really are .
 I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal  --  North and South  --  who is not affected personally .
 If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice ?
 ) , what voices would be left ?
 Who is involved willy nilly ?
 Well , after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools , only the poor folks are left .
 And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .
 A dear , respected friend of mine , who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England , said to me not long ago : "I ca n't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity"  .
 Being a teacher of American literature , I remembered Whittier's "Massachusetts to Virginia"  , where he said : "But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown"  .
 There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his "English Notebooks"  . and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves .
 Whether historically a fact or not , the legend has a certain symbolic value .
 Complicity is an embarrassing word .
 It is something which most of us try to get out from under .
 Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's "Blue Hotel"  , we run around crying , "Well , I did n't do anything , did I"  ?
 Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in "Brother to Dragons"  : "The recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence"  , where innocence , I think , means about the same thing as redemption .
 A man must be able to say , "Father , I have sinned"  , or there is no hope for him .
 Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his "Second Inaugural"  that God "gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came"  .
 He also spoke of "the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil"  .
 Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade .
 After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ?
 It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds .
 But did n't they get off too easy ?
 The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave-owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care .
 Emerson  --  Platonist , idealist , doctrinaire  --  sounded a high Transcendental note in his "Boston Hymn"  , delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : "Pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim . Who is the owner ?
 The slave is owner , And ever was . Pay him"  .
 !
 It is the abstractionism , the unrealism , of the pure idealist .
 It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .
 Like Pilate , they had washed their hands .
 But can one , really ?
 Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ?
 New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his "Autobiography"  : "The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it . Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others"  .
 .
 But that was a long time ago .
 The New England conscience became desensitized .
 George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ) , writing in 1889 from "Paradise Road , Northampton"  ( lovely symbolic name ) , agitated continuously the "Southern question"  .
 It was nice to be able to isolate it .
 New England , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation .
 There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the United States .
 Why should this be so ?
 It is true that New England , more than any other section , was dedicated to education from the start .
 But I think that something more than this is involved .
 How did it happen , for example , that the state university , that great symbol of American democracy , failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country ?
 Is n't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past , these institutions having previously been A&M colleges ?
 Was it supposed , perchance , that A&M ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ?
 Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state , Rhode Island , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university ?
 The state universities of Maine , New Hampshire , and Vermont are older and more "respectable"  ; they had less immigration to contend with .
 A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : "We in New England have long since segregated our children"  .
 He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .
 And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land !
 I do n't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises .
 One is that they were established , or gained eminence , under pressure provided by these same immigrants , from whom the old families wished to segregate their children .
 In the early days of a homogeneous population , the public school was quite satisfactory .
 AMONG THE RECIPIENTS of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English .
 Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .
 Equally a master of prose and verse , he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present .
 In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
 Heidenstam was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family .
 On his father's side he was of German descent , on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility .
 The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake V<auml>ttern in south central Sweden .
 It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .
 As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden's ancient glory .
 He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part .
 Being somewhat delicate in health , at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe , for which he at once developed a passion , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad , at first in Italy , then in Greece , Egypt , Asia Minor , and Palestine .
 In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .
 Deciding to become a painter , he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris , where he enjoyed the life of the artists , but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction .
 He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem , "The Happy Artists"  .
 "I scanned the world through printed symbol swart , And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man . I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart"  .
 .
 In this final line , we have the key to his nature .
 Few writers have better understood their deepest selves .
 Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface .
 It may , however , be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris .
 The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems , Pilgrimage and Wander-Years ( Vallfart och vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .
 It was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron's Childe Harold .
 Professor Fredrik Book , Sweden's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : "In this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid . In a bold , sometimes careless , form there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation is sharp and the imagination lively . The young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus . In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence , and for that reason he loves it . And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a cycle of short poems , "Thoughts in Loneliness"  .
 , filled with brooding , melancholy , and sombre longing"  .
 Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as "Nameless and Immortal"  , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language .
 It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence .
 On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .
 The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .
 Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .
 "The man's true reputation is his work"  .
 The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as "Thoughts in Loneliness"  is , as Professor Book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .
 It consists of fragmentary personal revelations , such as "The Spark"  : "There is a spark dwells deep within my soul . To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's aim both first and last , the whole . It slips away , it burns and tortures me . That little spark is all the wealth I know , That little spark is my life's misery"  .
 .
 A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : "Not men-folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used to play"  .
 He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading .
 What he really wants is to find "a sacred cause"  to which he can honestly devote himself .
 This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden .
 His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .
 He did not , however , find himself at once .
 His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .
 The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , "even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life . He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden"  .
 .
 From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self .
 By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions .
 He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .
 Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .
 He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory .
 Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up .
 Heidenstam's conception , on the contrary , was to revive the present by the memories of the past .
 Whether in prose or poetry , all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden .
 With the first of a group of historical novels , The Charles Men ( Karolinerna ) , published in 1897-8 , he achieved the masterpiece of his career .
 In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War and Peace .
 About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .
 Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles XII , the true hero is not finally the king himself .
 Hence the title of the book , referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , "the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people"  .
 The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .
 Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature .
 They comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war , idyllic interludes , superb canvases of world-shaking events , and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters .
 The general effect is tragic .
 Almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories , the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat .
 To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale .
 His peculiar gift , as had been suggested before , is his intensity .
 George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style .
 Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .
 The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters , of common folk even more than of major figures .
 The career of Charles XII is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon .
 His ideal was Alexander of Macedon , as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar .
 His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire , but to assert the principle of divine justice .
 Each aspired to be a god in human form , but with each it was a different kind of god .
 Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him .
 Each is still glorified as a national hero .
 The first half of The Charles Men , ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .
 After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .
 Like Napoleon , he was the worst of losers .
 There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity .
 Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness .
 This comes out in "When the Bells Ring"  , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes .
 In "The King's Ride"  , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years .
 He finds it in utter misery and desolation .
 All his people ask for is no more war .
 But he plunges into yet another , this time with Norway , and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall , being only thirty-six years of age when he died .
 He had become king at fifteen .
 Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling .
 From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden .
 This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book , "A Hero's Funeral"  , written in the form of an impassioned prose poem .
 Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral , the shrine of so many precious memories .
 The guns are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .
 As he had longed to be , he became the echo of a saga .
 Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory .
 Excellent in their way , they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .
 It is different with his volume The Swedes and Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .
 Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries .
 Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural , as suited to the legendary background .
 These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .
 Especially touching is the chapter , "The Little Sister"  , about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta .
 The record teems with romance and adventure .
 Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles X , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so .
 Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII it is unnecessary to speak .
 DOES our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ?
 Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth .
 Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ?
 Noting such evidence is the first step ; and almost the only "cure"  is early detection and removal .
 One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .
 So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .
 In any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the "disease"  , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .
 Have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ?
 Hence the prime issue , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature .
 We are already committed to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today .
 Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate .
 We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .
 We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ?
 So in these pages the term "technology"  is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man's control over himself and over other men .
 Naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control .
 Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution .
 If we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man's best growth .
 But we can not start off with a clean slate .
 So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs .
 Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today .
 At first glance this appears strange : of all people , was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring "undeveloped"  societies abroad ?
 But hear Harrison E. Salisbury , former Moscow correspondent of The New York Times , and author of "To Moscow  --  And Beyond"  .
 In a book review of "The Soviet Cultural Offensive"  , he says , "Long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of Porgy and Bess overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary cultural warfare behind the enemy lines . They were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford , Hugh Cooper , Thomas Campbell , the International Harvester Co. , and David W. Griffith . Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies . This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-American propaganda ..."  .
 Perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the "rugged capitalist entrepreneur"  no more exists in America .
 In his stead is a milquetoast version known as "the corporation"  .
 But even if we can not see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; and our loss of "prestige"  abroad is the direct result .
 No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts .
 If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .
 First , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se can not take economic leadership .
 Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind .
 When we "forced"  individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what I would term "pseudo-capitalism"  and so took a major step toward socialism .
 The biggest loss , of course , was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy .
 Socialism , I grant , has a definite place in our society .
 But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic .
 Some forms of capitalism do indeed work  --  superb organizations , a credit to any society .
 But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny .
 Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham .
 It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that .
 As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in "swallowing"  creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .
 As to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services .
 The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy .
 But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it can not constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .
 So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival .
 The corporation has a limited , specific place in our society .
 Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society .
 Examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e.g. constructing major airports or dams .
 Thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs .
 In all other areas , private initiative of the "proprietorship"  type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .
 Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .
 Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations can not .
 It can project long-range goals for itself .
 Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e. g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports .
 Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations , being more amorphous , can not .
 Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community .
 Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public .
 The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders .
 Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop .
 Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now .
 Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest .
 Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .
 Corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ) .
 The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .
 To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic .
 When the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it .
 Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole .
 Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship .
 Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so .
 If we can not stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ?
 These proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology .
 Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition .
 The battle is not easy .
 We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .
 Persons developed in to-day's corporations can not hope to serve here  --  a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside .
 In my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which "normal"  corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .
 Also , I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees .
 Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family .
 This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .
 Perhaps a list of some of the "practices"  of my company will help here .
 The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles .
 From an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures to the public ) .
 Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation is in evidence .
 Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition .
 IT HAS recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres .
 The results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 ) .
 When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon .
 Observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface .
 Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .
 The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600 degree K .
 This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence .
 For the case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components .
 Of the remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available .
 Mars has been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .
 The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin .
 No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity .
 In spite of this , the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years .
 The study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25-cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 ) .
 This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .
 They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3 days after Full Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at Full Moon .
 Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves , although opaque to infrared radiation .
 The infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase .
 Since the absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material .
 The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter .
 This sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 ) .
 Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958a , b , c ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 ) .
 In the relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm .
 The observable characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves .
 The maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc .
 This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk can not be resolved .
 It should be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers .
 Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth .
 There have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation .
 The measurements made with the NRL 50-foot reflector , which is altitude-azimuth-mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized .
 Recent interferometer measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960-Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk .
 Other than this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation .
 The concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets .
 The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet .
 The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation .
 The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material .
 The radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise .
 The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 degree K .
 At meter wave lengths an increase of the order of 10 degree K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected .
 Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter-and decimeter-wave-length range .
 Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1 .
 Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; see also chap. 11 ) .
 Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures .
 In the observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959a ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6 .7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases .
 These observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions .
 Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .
 These contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude .
 Very recently , observations have been made at 8-mm wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) .
 The constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959a ) , and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features .
 Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted .
 The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described .
 Measurements at 3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50-foot reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington .
 The half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam was about 9 , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes .
 The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958b ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known .
 The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85 .
 The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon's disk is nearly uniform .
 The result of the observations is ( in degree K )  x = y  where the phase angle , <phgr> t , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors .
 This result is plotted along with the 8.6-mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , a .
 The variation in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much less than the variation in the 8.6-mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .
 In the discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component .
 The 10.3-cm observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84-foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory .
 The age of the moon was about 2 days .
 The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18 .5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon .
 Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) .
 Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc .
 It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the total arc energy .
 A detailed energy balance of the anode was established .
 The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount .
 The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Amp .
 Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities .
 The high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation .
 The cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode .
 In free burning electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of  x = y  as measured by the authors  --  the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere .
 In plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode .
 The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs .
 In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat .
 The heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1. Heat of condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode .
 This energy transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .
 2. Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column .
 The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up  x = y  .
 This phenomenon has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker ( Ref. 1 ) .
 The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) .
 Hence , the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point .
 It is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode .
 The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux .
 An attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss .
 The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1. The use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output .
 2. Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces .
 3. Feed back of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode .
 The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers ( Ref. 2 ) .
 The purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage .
 Gas injection through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself .
 A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .
 Argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction .
 The anode material was porous graphite .
 Sintered porous metals should be usable in principle .
 However , technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots .
 The experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs .
 Thus , direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref. 3 ) .
 Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder .
 The cathode consisted of a <frac14> diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube .
 This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .
 The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk .
 The transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below .
 Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2 .
 Argon was also blown at low velocities ( mass flow rate  x = y  ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air .
 The anode consisted of a  inch diameter porous graphite plug , <frac14> inch long .
 The graphite was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 .
 This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode .
 The anode plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder .
 A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas .
 It was exposed to a high velocity gas jet .
 A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts .
 This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection .
 Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer Instrument Co. Model 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder .
 Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature .
 Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 .
 In this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant .
 To reduce heat transfer from the hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of <fra116> inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder .
 In addition , the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation .
 Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug .
 The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator .
 The power source was a commercial D. C. rectifier .
 At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load .
 The current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter .
 The arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders .
 Because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation .
 A high frequency starter was used to start the arc .
 The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind .
 The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made .
 In order to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5 and a current of 100 Amp .
 The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between  x = y  and  x = y  .
 The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable .
 The upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc .
 This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously .
 For each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured .
 To measure the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer .
 As it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug .
 Its temperature was denoted by  x = y  .
 The size of this hot region was estimated by eye .
 The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug .
 The mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug .
 It was denoted by  x = y  .
 The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation :  x = y  where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot .
 Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation  x = y  whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as  x = y  .
 This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures .
 The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was  x = y  .
 The  x = y  values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages .
 Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 .
 Some of these temperatures are plotted in figure 4 .
 They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements .
 Thus , the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates .
 The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of  x = y  .
 This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned .
 It is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements .
 The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry .
 The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts .
 It was calculated from the temperature gradient  x = y  at  x = y  inch as  x = y  .
 The total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby  x = y  The temperature distribution of figure 4 gives  x = y  for all blowing rates , assuming  x = y  .
 The temperature dependent value of <egr> was taken from Ref. 7 .
 The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to  x = y  where  x = y  is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures  x = y  and  x = y  calculated analogously to equation (1) .
 A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2 .
 It consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims .
 There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .
 A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .
 In normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks .
 After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded .
 By the use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained .
 The instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described .
 In this test a  x = y  tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of  x = y  with a clearance of 0.002 on each side of the tape .
 This gives a rate of shear of  x = y  .
 This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs .
 The face of one block contained a hole <fra116> in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure .
 Although there were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types .
 Two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two .
 Figure 3 shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12,500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure .
 Although the tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate .
 A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .
 A back pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure .
 By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere .
 The actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand .
 The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300 .
 These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight .
 The maximum suction was 3.25 of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids .
 It is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus .
 This negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head  x = y  since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes .
 These experiments can be considered exploratory only .
 However , they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper .
 They also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures .
 Such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies .
 The elasticity as a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials .
 Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed "length"  , "shortness"  , "spinnability"  , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present .
 The actual change  x = y  caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head .
 If the volume is the molal volume , then  x = y  is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists .
 Although the  x = y  calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects .
 Consider a shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of h ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of a .
 If  x = y  is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and <rgr> is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is  x = y  .
  x = y  is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h .
 The total volume of the system above the reference height is  x = y  , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H .
 The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero .
 This gives  x = y  , which is the pressure .
 This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium .
 This method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields .
 The relation between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way .
 In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state .
 This can be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared .
 This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that "the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions"  .
 There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .
 If the mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar .
 The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference  x = y  and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .
 Essentially these birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 degree to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear .
 According to Philippoff , the recoverable shear s is given by  x = y  where <khgr> is the angle of extinction .
 From this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the  x = y  calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face .
 There is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields .
 These droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands .
 These droplets appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are .
 If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .
 The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids .
 Mason and Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45 degree at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear .
 Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup .
 This is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies .
 The relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume : (A) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop .
 That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .
 The kinetic effects are negligible .
 Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid .
 These are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear .
 Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is  x = y  and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is  x = y  , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is  x = y  , where <ggr> is the interfacial tension and  x = y  and  x = y  are the two radii of curvature .
 This formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason .
 If a is the major axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis is  x = y  , and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is  x = y  .
 There are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas .
 However , there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok .
 This viscosity of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible .
 Measurements on the photograph in this paper give  x = y  at the maximum rate of shear of  x = y  .
 If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of  x = y  , cosec 2 <khgr> applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated .
 Its value was  x = y  from the above data .
 This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops .
 It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation .
 The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .
 In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink .
 This means that work equals q which in turn equals  x = y  .
 There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that  x = y  , where q is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone .
 This is known as conformational entropy .
 This conformational entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved .
 Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure .
 The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings .
 A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline  x = y  as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .
  x = y  is paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening .
 The lines are asymmetric and over the range of field  x = y  gauss and temperature  x = y  the asymmetry increases with increasing  x = y  and decreasing T .
 An isotropic resonance shift of  x = y  to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction .
 The general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment  x = y  of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to  x = y  .
 The theory predicts a linear dependence of  x = y  on  x = y  , where <thgr> is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant .
 The experimental second moment  x = y  conforms to the relation  x = y  in agreement with theory .
 Hence , the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept ) .
 The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes .
 The nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the  x = y  bond in  x = y  remains in doubt .
 THE magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei .
 It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure .
  x = y  appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong  x = y  bond provides structural interest .
 We first discuss the  x = y  bond in  x = y  .
 We then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment .
 Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects .
 The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the  x = y  bond in  x = y  .
 Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the  x = y  bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid .
 Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical  x = y  distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric .
 There is ample evidence from many sources that the  x = y  bond in  x = y  is symmetric .
 The  x = y  distance in  x = y  is 2.26 A .
 There is evidence , though less convincing than for  x = y  , that the  x = y  bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric .
 Here the  x = y  distance is 2.44 A .
 A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the  x = y  bond becomes symmetric when the  x = y  bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric  x = y  bonds .
 Douglass has studied the crystal structure of  x = y  by x-ray diffraction .
 He finds the structure contains an  x = y  bond with the  x = y  distance of  x = y  .
 There is , then , the possibility that this  x = y  bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data .
 Douglass found  x = y  to be trigonal , Laue symmetry  x = y  , with  x = y  ,  x = y  .
 X-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of  x = y  .
 The x-ray data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry .
 Under this assumption the space group must be  x = y  and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell .
  x = y  .
 This space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric .
 Douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for  x = y  .
 These data lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms .
 The O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms The  x = y  layers are stacked normal to the [111] axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers .
 The separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds .
 A drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 .
 The gross details of the structure appear reasonable .
 The structure appears to be unique among ROOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by  x = y  .
 The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal .
 However , the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off  x = y  , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with  x = y  at  x = y  and  x = y  at  x = y  ( space group  x = y  ) , where  x = y  represents the oxygens on one side of the  x = y  layers and  x = y  those on the other side .
 However , any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short  x = y  interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non-hydrogen-bonded  x = y  interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 A .
 Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence .
 The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the [111] axis .
 If the  x = y  bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : (1) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; (2) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; (3) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms .
 Position (2) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds .
 A randomization of "ups"  and "downs"  is more likely than ordered "ups"  and "downs"  in position (3) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered "up"  and "down"  implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists .
 Therefore , the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .
 Douglass prepared his sample of  x = y  by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300-325 <deg>C .
 Dr. Douglass was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material .
 This material proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample .
 Subsequently , we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent  x = y  impurity .
 Since  x = y  is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated  x = y  would be suspect .
 Plane suggested another preparation of  x = y  which we used here .
 500 ml of 1 M aqueous  x = y  with 1 g  x = y  added are heated in a bomb at 170 <deg>C for 48 hours .
 A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110 <deg>C .
 Differential thermal analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340 <deg>C and a large endothermic reaction at 470 <deg>C .
 This latter reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of  x = y  .
 Thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337 <deg>C and another weight loss of 10.8% at 463 <deg>C .
 The expected weight loss for  x = y  going to  x = y  and  x = y  is 10.6% .
 Mass spectrometric analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410 <deg>C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor .
 The small reaction occurring at 337 <deg>C is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than  x = y  .
 All subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375 <deg>C for one hour .
 Emission spectra indicated  x = y  calcium and all other impurities much lower .
 Chromium analysis gave 58.8% Cr as compared with 61.2% theory .
 However ,  x = y  adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss .
 The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material , taken with CuK <agr> radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass .
 Magnetic analyses by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities .
  x = y  was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of  x = y  , where  x = y  .
 For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10 .
 An infrared spectrum , obtained by H. A. Benesi and R. G. Snyder of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones .
 Electron microscopic examination of the  x = y  sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3 <mgr> in diameter .
 The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this .
 The x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater .
 We found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination .
 The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model  x = y  broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch electromagnet system .
 One measurement at 40 Mc <sol> sec was obtained with the Varian model  x = y  unit .
 A bridged-T type of bridge was used in the 10-16 Mc <sol> sec range .
 The rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects .
 A modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was used .
 Background spectra were obtained in all cases .
 The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal .
 A single value of the thermal relaxation time  x = y  at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method .
 The value of  x = y  estimated at 470 gauss was  x = y  microseconds .
 A single measurement of the spin-spin relaxation time  x = y  was obtained at 10 Mc <sol> sec by pulse methods .
 This measurement was obtained by W. Blumberg of the University of California , Berkeley , by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal .
 The value derived was 16 microseconds .
 Field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero .
 Second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration .
 Corrections were applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift .
 Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77-294 <deg>K .
 For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades .
 The temperature was maintained to within about  x = y  for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) .
 One sample , which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375 <deg>C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt% ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature .
 The data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375 <deg>C which contain no adsorbed water .
 The measured powder density of the  x = y  used here was about  x = y  , approximately one-third that of the crystal density (  x = y  ) .
 Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about  x = y  .
 Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 4 : 1 .
 The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical .
 Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube .
 The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary .
 Spectra were also obtained from a third sample of  x = y  which had been diluted to three times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum (  x = y  ) .
 This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above .
 Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited .
 The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse .
 The best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use .
 These widely advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate .
 In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised .
 A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder <sol> active ratio .
 Hard-surface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork .
 The better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders .
 In addition , many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products .
 Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates .
 These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 .
 Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces .
 Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material .
 An oversimplified differentiation between soft-and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved .
 One gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of  x = y  .
 In contrast , a metal coupon  x = y  in size would have a magnitude from 100,000 to a million less .
 Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity .
 Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface roughness .
 There are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning .
 Exclusive of esthetic values , such as high-or low-foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high .
 No matter how they are formulated , a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal .
 This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation .
 A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of "tattle-tale grey"  and dirty spots  --  sometimes with bad results even after the first wash .
 Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents .
 Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics .
 Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use .
 The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash .
 In this way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing .
 Soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones .
 As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high .
 Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice .
 The problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex .
 In hard-surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active .
 Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation .
 Hydroxides , orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners .
 In addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else .
 The importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers .
 Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces .
 The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : Dirt , which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties .
 Greasy soils , which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids ) .
 Stains , which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object .
 Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue .
 The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent .
 However , a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of van der Waal's forces .
 This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick to an uncharged surface .
 Obviously , if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced .
 Likewise , a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge .
 In addition , dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids , including liquid greases .
 Greases , stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface .
 In most cases , these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action .
 In an essentially static system , an oil can not be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent .
 The washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a dissolving and solvating agent .
 Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove .
 Therefore , detergents are used .
 The detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils .
 The other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils .
 As is well known , detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution .
 Physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration .
 1 ) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present .
 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60-80 .
 3 ) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase .
 Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances such as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase .
 Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold .
 Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process .
 Related to micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil-water interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase .
 In the cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant .
 Then during washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase .
 Obviously , a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil .
 Substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases .
 This is particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes .
 Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see Table 26-2 on p. 1678 ) .
 Thus , for aqueous media , we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent .
 From the equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge .
 The charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions .
 The negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase .
 This hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency .
 It does not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will be discussed later ( see pp. 1746-1748 ) .
 The crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as :  x = y  The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale .
 Freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation .
 Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil .
 It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .
 Upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having "synergistic"  properties has gained widespread acceptance .
 In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a "pure"  role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active .
 The thermal exchange of chlorine between  x = y  and liquid  x = y  is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180 degree and above .
 The photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65 degree using light absorbed only by the  x = y  .
 In the gas phase , with  x = y  of  x = y  and  x = y  of  x = y  , quantum yields of the order of  x = y  have been observed at 85 degree .
 Despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction .
 It appears possible to set a lower limit of about  x = y  for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form  x = y  radical .
 The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions .
 Because of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data .
 It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond .
 The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies .
 It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid .
 It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine .
 Furthermore , the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that  x = y  would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for  x = y  radicals .
 Contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents .
 We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride .
 .
 Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of resublimed  x = y  into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air .
 It was then distilled at least three times from a trap at <minus>78 degree to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation .
 The purified product was stored at <minus>78 degree in a tube equipped with a break seal .
 Of several methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine , the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory .
 To prepare the latter , silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing  x = y  obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
 The silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of  x = y  which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line .
 Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place .
 The radiochlorine was stored at <minus>78 degree in a tube equipped with a break seal .
 Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated with  x = y  and  x = y  and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches .
 The mixture was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column , a 25% center cut being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of  x = y  .
 Purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal .
 This chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off .
 The required amount of carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line .
 The desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off .
 The contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking , redistributed to the reaction tubes , frozen down , and each tube was then sealed off .
 The reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off .
 This method in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set .
 .
 The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long .
 In a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness .
 Both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220 degree .
 The photochemical reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm. long , diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces .
 These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride .
 The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window .
 Two types of light source were used , a thousand watt projection lamp and an AH5 high pressure mercury arc .
 The light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell .
 Relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system .
 Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell .
 Following reaction the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous sodium iodide solution .
 Carrier  x = y  was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide ) .
 After titration of the liberated  x = y  with  x = y  , aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube .
 In the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments after emptying .
 The fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts <sol> minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts <sol> minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride , empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of  x = y  in  x = y  and  x = y  .
 .
 In studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed .
 Experiments were done at 180 , 200 , 210 , 220 degree .
 Following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent. , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes .
 In addition to the method described in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a  x = y  eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of  x = y  with molten  x = y  .
 Calcium hydride was substituted for  x = y  as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride .
 No correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found .
 The reaction rates observed at 200 degree ranged from  x = y  of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour .
 In most cases the chlorine concentration was about  x = y  .
 Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour .
 No detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours .
 .
 The liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic .
 The improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold .
 Rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings .
 Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85 degree in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity .
 In all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination .
 By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18  x = y  was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases It was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source .
 These estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65 degree is of the order of magnitude of unity .
 When typical reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced .
 Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at  x = y  .
 .
 Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate .
 Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table I .
 In series I the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm .
 The last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity .
 Direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series II where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen .
 The Poynting-Robertson effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth .
 The radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size  --  a 1000-<mgr>-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years .
 Whipple ( 1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag .
 Further , the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force .
 The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun .
 Also , planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached .
 At one astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular .
 If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about  x = y  km of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .
 De Jager ( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi-major axis .
 This effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth .
 Since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space .
 There are several possible sources .
 According to Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state .
 Asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material .
 It is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon .
 One can not make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space .
 Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude .
 This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved .
 Beyond a few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable .
 At greater distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain .
 There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment .
 Direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors .
 In addition , the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain .
 From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane .
 Another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component .
 The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category .
 The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .
 The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes .
 Statistically , the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer I ) , 1958 Delta 2 ( Sputnik III ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard III ) .
 These vehicles , with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure .
 Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information .
 The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was  x = y  for particles of mass greater than  x = y  ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of  x = y  .
 The data show daily and diurnal variations .
 Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude .
 One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth's orbit .
 There have been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable .
 On May 15 , a very large increase occurred with  x = y  of mass between  x = y  and  x = y  ; for the next two days , the impact rate was  x = y  ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than  x = y  ( Nazarova , 1960 ) .
 The data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux .
 Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of  x = y  for masses larger than  x = y  for about 1000 events in a 22-day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 ) .
 The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor of 4.5 .
 The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations .
 Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large .
 If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass-distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse <frac72> power of the radius .
 Space probes have yielded little information .
 Pioneer I recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours .
 With detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones .
 Being based on so few events , these results are of dubious validity .
 The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain .
 Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities .
 However , one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship .
 In the United States , most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces .
 The Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor .
 This "ejection"  momentum is linearly related to the particle energy .
 They quote about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater .
 There is a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin .
 The threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of  x = y  in the U.S. work and  x = y  in the U.S.S.R. work .
 The threshold mass of about  x = y  corresponds to a 10-<mgr>-diameter sphere of density  x = y  .
 However , the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as  x = y  .
 To what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown .
 The velocity value used is also open to some question ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass .
 Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors .
 The diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity .
 The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data .
 A summary of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5-1 .
 From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude .
 The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density  x = y  except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure .
 The flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors .
 It is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant .
 The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta .
 The figures in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere .
 The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth .
 Of course , if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here .
 Note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; for example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a  x = y  , zero-magnitude meteorite .
 The older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light .
 The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 ) .
 A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 ) .
 Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .
 The approximate equation is  x = y  , where n is the number of  x = y  with electron line-density greater than or equal to  x = y  , and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite .
 Therefore , n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse <frac72> power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data .
 At the fifteenth magnitude ,  x = y  , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude ,  x = y  .
 These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table .
 The extrapolation may be in error for several reasons .
 The observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region .
 The solar-electromagnetic-and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns .
 Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected .
 A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 ) .
 Most meteoritic material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere .
 For all meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent .
 This is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx .
 Present data indicate an accretion of about  x = y  tons per year over the entire globe , or about  x = y  .
 Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man .
 It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems .
 Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals .
 Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon .
 The major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect .
 The incubation period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter .
 A man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases .
 Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities .
 An important operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area .
 This concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence .
 The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years .
 Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics .
 Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques .
 Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures .
 The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms .
 The importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated .
 The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract , such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence .
 Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs .
 This area is highly susceptible to infection .
 The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation .
 The relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1 .
 In considering BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect .
 For example , bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air .
 There are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne .
 Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface .
 It will rise during lapse conditions .
 There are , of course , certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met .
 Certain other properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract , are noteworthy in defense considerations .
 The smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out .
 An aerosol of such small particles . moreover , diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas .
 There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc .
 Depending on the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products , i.e. , in milk for example .
 The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense .
 Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials : In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions .
 Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated .
 This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment .
 Four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles .
 Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial .
 The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles .
 From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered .
 These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case .
 The behavior of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism .
 An aqueous suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles .
 A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns .
 In this test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of  x = y  organisms per ml , or a total of approximately  x = y  spores , was aerosolized .
 The spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze .
 Spraying continued along a two-mile course .
 This operation was started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes .
 There was a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative humidity .
 A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore .
 These were located at the homes of Government employees , in Government Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area .
 A rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government office building .
 All samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours .
 In this instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period , a four-fold increase .
 This suggests that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased .
 As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol .
 The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source .
 As can be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled .
 It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind .
 The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were :  x = y  This was not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol .
 A number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal of entry .
 Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal .
 Botulinal toxin , for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os .
 In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult .
 In tularemia produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of "rabbit fever"  on a finger .
 An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious .
 Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category .
 An agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements .
 It is , obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property .
 In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction .
 Moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable .
 An aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population .
 A solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized .
 It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent .
 There is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made .
 An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality .
 It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains .
 Mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification .
 All of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management .
 Biological agents are , of course , highly host-specific .
 They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives .
 This may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives .
 The question of epidemic disease merits some discussion .
 Only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem .
 Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics .
 They then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated .
 They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease .
 this is why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention .
 Our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target .
 This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease .
 A hypothetical example will illustrate this point .
 Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( Rickettsia prowazwki ) over City A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom .
 No epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy .
 Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus .
 In this case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack .
 This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic .
 On the other hand , a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy .
 One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack .
 The major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices .
 It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons .
 The same delivery vehicles  --  whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles  --  should be usable .
 If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city .
 Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense .
 A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned .
 The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack .
 America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods .
 This is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage .
 One must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products .
 Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack .
 A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies .
 These include low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses .
 Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators .
 Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose .
 Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from DEAE-cellulose .
 Fahey and Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated <ggr>-globulin samples .
 In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described .
 .
 Serum samples were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors .
 Three of the anti-Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals .
 One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline .
 The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect Coombs test .
 The third , containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had titers of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect Coombs test .
 In addition one serum was obtained from a donor ( R. E. ) who had been sensitized 6 years previously .
 This serum exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect Coombs test .
 These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous  x = y  red cells .
 .
 Anti-A and anti-B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods .
 One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group  x = y  or group B red cells in a small  x = y  test tube .
 In several instances group O cells were also used as controls .
 The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use .
 The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr .
 the tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for agglutination .
 For the albumin method , equal volumes of 30% bovine albumin , sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min .
 All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods .
 The activities of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques .
 Homozygous and heterozygous  x = y  cells ,  x = y  and homozygous and heterozygous  x = y  cells were used to test each sample ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous  x = y  and homozygous  x = y  cells will be presented here .
 The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37 <deg>C before centrifugation .
 The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner .
 The cells were washed three times with saline , anti-human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination .
 The anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits .
 Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the "broad spectrum"  type were selected for used in the present study .
 The red cells for the Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the  x = y  cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at <minus>20 <deg>C for approximately 1 year .
 These cells were thawed at 37 <deg>C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2% ) .
 The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2% in saline .
 .
 Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed .
 The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately 750 ml each , of "starting buffer"  .
 This buffer , pH 8.6 , was 0.005 M in  x = y  and 0.039 M in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane ( Tris ) .
 After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a  x = y  cm column of DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer .
 The DEAE-cellulose , containing 0.78 mEq of N <sol> g , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100-230 mesh .
 The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity .
 The chromatography was done at 6 <deg>C using gradient elution , essentially according to Sober and Peterson .
 The deep concave gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a nine-chambered gradient elution device ( "Varigrad"  , reference (8) ) and has been described elsewhere .
 The other , a shallow concave gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called "cone-sphere"  apparatus , the "cone"  being a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask and the "sphere ,"  a 2-liter round-bottom flask .
 Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , 0.50 M in both  x = y  and Tris , pH 4.1 .
 A flow rate of 72  x = y  was used and 12 ml fractions were collected .
 Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column .
 These were read at 280 m<mgr> in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above .
 .
 For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5 <deg>C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline .
 During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2 <deg>C by surrounding the apparatus with ice .
 Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments .
 Paper electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room temperature on Whatman 3MM filter paper .
 Five milliamperes <sol> cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol .
 When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run <sol> chamber under the conditions described above .
 At the end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1 <deg>C .
 The unstained strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands .
 The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity .
 .
 Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline , pH 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154 .
 They were then centrifuged at 59,780 rpm for 35 to 80 min at 20 <deg>C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25% .
 Sedimentation coefficients were computed as  x = y  values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns .
 For preparative ultracentrifugation , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline .
 Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run .
 Successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity .
 Other methods will be described below .
 The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood group of the donor .
 With either of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity .
 These have been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1 .
 When the early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the "cone-sphere"  gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P. J. and R. S. , Fig. 1 and E. M. , Fig. 2 ) .
 The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2 .
 In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) .
 Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig. 1 ) .
 Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas .
 In all cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity .
 This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all .
 There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti-A and anti-B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) .
 Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al .
 These fractions were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control .
 As expected , most of the activity was found in Fraction  x = y  , with slight activity seen in Fraction IV-1 .
 A sample of Fraction  x = y  from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 .
 Once again , both anti-A and anti-B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis .
 Similarly , both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) .
 Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide .
 The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram ; the complete , in the latter part .
 The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 ) .
 In all cases the activity against  x = y  cells was spread over a wider area than that with  x = y  cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison .
 The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity .
 In fact agglutination of  x = y  cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing "only"  incomplete antibody activity .
 This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected .
 Apart from the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor .
 Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all .
 They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt .
 I must add at once that these animals are what we call "queens"  , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn .
 It is on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather .
 Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease .
 The survivors emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50 degree F and there is not too much wind .
 Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins .
 The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies .
 It is a happy , buzzing crowd .
 Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers .
 It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black-tipped little scale .
 By scrutinizing the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts .
 Those are the nectaries or honey glands ( Fig. 26 , page 74 ) .
 The staminate willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed .
 The only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites .
 I will deal with these later on .
 Quite often , honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins .
 As we have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange .
 Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus ; there must be several dozen species in the United States alone .
 If you really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees and Their Ways by O. E. Plath .
 If we manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep .
 As befits a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting place .
 Most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest , a bird house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss .
 Once she has made up her mind , the queen starts out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small "floor"  of dried grass or some woolly material .
 On this , she builds an "egg compartment"  or "egg cell"  which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture called beebread .
 She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey .
 Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed .
 The queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots .
 When the larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother .
 She continues to add to the pollen supply as needed .
 The larvae , kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days .
 Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates .
 After another two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying .
 The first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season .
 The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed .
 By the middle of the summer , many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is "optimal"  , and it is then that young queens begin to appear .
 Simultaneously , males or drones are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen .
 The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter .
 It is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing , for instance , in August .
 The temperature then is still very high .
 At the old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females .
 As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely .
 The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths .
 Not always , though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described .
 Some members of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives .
 Bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the "cuckoo-bumblebee"  as it is called in some European countries .
 Female individuals of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize .
 The one sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets  --  naturally !
 The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host .
 When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment .
 The hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally .
 Thus , the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread .
 Later on , they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers .
 Worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills off the Bombus queen .
 But let us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; there are other wild bees that command our attention .
 It is almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining bees .
 There are about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone .
 One of my favorites is A. armata , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee .
 The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds .
 Almost equal in size to a honeybee , A. armata is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red .
 The males are much duller .
 After having mated , an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground , forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil .
 The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or "cells"  , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread .
 The development of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults .
 But they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter .
 Their appearance , next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants .
 In the Sacramento valley in California , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins .
 This must be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal .
 After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated .
 Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee .
 Its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species .
 After all , social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature .
 On the basis of its life history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees .
 The way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either .
 It lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect .
 Still Andrena will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind .
 Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees .
 Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington .
 In the United States Department of Agriculture's Yearbook of Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females .
 Often the burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres .
 The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage .
 In most places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer .
 I must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias .
 This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period .
 The name "alkali bee"  indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places .
 Sometimes , although by no means always , these are indeed alkaline .
 The thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either .
 They dislike dense vegetation .
 Where does one find such conditions ?
 The best chance , of course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth .
 The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout .
 The pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type I , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 ) .
 Another marked difference is noted here .
 The pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 ) .
 The bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply .
 It does , as in type I , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles  --  terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole .
 No bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group .
 Lung type III ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types I and II .
 It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig. 9 ) .
 The most distal airways are similar to those found in type I , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs. 14 , 15 ) .
 In this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type I .
 Air-drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable .
 Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type I ( fig. 24 ) .
 This relationship , however , is not maintained centrally .
 Here the pulmonary vein , as in type II , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs. 23 , 24 ) .
 The bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals .
 As seen in types I and II , it supplies the hilar lymph nodes , vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein , the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles .
 As in type I , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 ) .
 This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches .
 Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once .
 Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface .
 With completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches .
 An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted .
 This was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery .
 The diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 ) .
 In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery .
 This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed ( figs. 17 , 18 ) .
 Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; through the interlobular septa ; and along the terminal bronchiole ( figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) .
 One bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig. 26 ) .
 It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made .
 The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined .
 However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse .
 The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse .
 Also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; and , in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van Allen and Lindskog ,'31 ) .
 A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present .
 Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well .
 For example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types I and III .
 One might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse .
 In addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog .
 Anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum ,'54 ) in the human being .
 The only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries .
 As early as 1858 , Le Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings .
 In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .
 The opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ('50 ) .
 Apparently , however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study ( Loosli ,'38 ) .
 Although Miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat ( Miller ,'13 ;'25 ) .
 The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear .
 However , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung .
 The alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues .
 Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner ,'13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe ,'58 ) .
 Therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus .
 If this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema .
 One would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types I or II .
 The presence of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others .
 Nakamura ('58 ) , Verloop ('48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ('50 ) , von Hayek ('53 ) , and Tobin ('52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being .
 Miller ('50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint .
 In criticism of the latter's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level .
 As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure .
 Berry , Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this .
 Our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards .
 It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable .
 This viewpoint is further supported by Verloop's ('48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves .
 In other words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts .
 In addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses .
 Verloop ('48 ;'49 ) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats .
 Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ('52 ) also were unable to find them in rats .
 Nakamura ('58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs .
 The possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred .
 Certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species .
 It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog .
 In conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs .
 In addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent .
 Also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man .
 This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man .
 Finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species .
 The main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented .
 A tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types .
 Type I is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; type II , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; type III , by the horse .
 Lobularity is extremely well developed in type I ; absent in type II ; imperfectly developed in type III .
 The pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types I and III .
 The pleura is extremely thin in type II and septa are absent .
 Arterial supply to the pleura in types I and III is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type II , by the pulmonary artery .
 In types I , II and III the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole .
 In type III the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed .
 True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types I and III , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present .
 Well developed respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type II .
 In type I the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum .
 This may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present .
 In type III this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type II .
 Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex .
 In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated .
 Moreover , the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions .
 Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress .
 A previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges .
 It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism .
 In addition , the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the "communication of affect"  demonstrates .
 But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex .
 MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions .
 It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity .
 Previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response .
 The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper .
 After this brief discussion of neo- , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance .
 Facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways .
 Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges .
 On the other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored .
 Apparently , a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex .
 Consequently , if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges .
 Obviously , a vicious cycle develops .
 This tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways .
 It is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism .
 Before we comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness .
 Thus , a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition .
 Moreover , the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system .
 With the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur .
 Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus .
 Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals .
 Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect .
 Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance .
 The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs , the latter the tranquilizers .
 Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as , for instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine .
 Important as these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes .
 The emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs .
 The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance .
 Physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges .
 They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side .
 This explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test .
 Some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm .
 Nevertheless , the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients .
 The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable .
 It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle .
 A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting .
 In both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs .
 The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated .
 Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity .
 A state of parasympathetic "tuning"  of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response !
 Furthermore , conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic "tuning"  are observed .
 If , for instance , such a change is produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned reactions reappear .
 However , if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished .
 In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes .
 It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the EEG .
 These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes .
 The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion .
 If this is the case , one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise .
 We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( "abreaction"  ) may cure a battle neurosis .
 This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses .
 Being a strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself .
 Wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area .
 He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible .
 An important observation of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means .
 In a conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain .
 A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding .
 The pain became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned reflex ) .
 Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain .
 Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding .
 Appropriate experiments showed that this is , indeed , possible .
 He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .
 He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established .
 For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions .
 The feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho-and ergotropic systems .
 Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety .
 Although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic-somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle tone , and the Mecholyl test .
 The psychological incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference .
 In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively .
 We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical discharge .
 Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents .
 In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes .
 .
 In <sect> 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers .
 These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol  x = y  .
 Then in <sect> 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that (a) It has no complex of invariant lines , and (b) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in <sect> 1 .
 No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible .
 Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli  x = y  and  x = y  , and let g be a  x = y  curve of order k on Q .
 A general line l meets Q in two points ,  x = y  and  x = y  , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus ,  x = y  , whose lines are simple secants of g .
 On these generators let  x = y  and  x = y  be , respectively , the harmonic conjugates of  x = y  and  x = y  with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets g The line  x = y  is the image of l .
 Clearly , the transformation is involutorial .
 We observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q .
 For if it did , the plane of l and l<prime> would contain two generators of  x = y  , which is impossible .
 Moreover , from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of  x = y  , it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meets its image are the points of g .
 Hence the totality of singular lines is the kth order complex of lines which meet g .
 The invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of g , since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant .
 The order of this congruence is  x = y  , since  x = y  secants of a curve of symbol ( a , b ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point .
 The class of the congruence is  x = y  , since an arbitrary plane meets g in k points .
 Since the complex of singular lines is of order k and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula  x = y  that the order of the involution is  x = y  .
 There are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique .
 The most obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to Q , each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line .
 Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents .
 It is interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils , so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent .
 For the lines of any plane , <pgr> , meeting Q in a conic C , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve C<prime> into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q .
 In particular , tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C<prime> .
 Moreover , if  x = y  and  x = y  are two planes intersecting in a line l , tangent to Q at a point P , the two free intersections of the image curves  x = y  and  x = y  must coincide at P<prime> , the image of P , and at this point  x = y  and  x = y  must have a common tangent l<prime> .
 Hence , thought of as a line in a particular plane <pgr> , any tangent to Q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through l .
 Each generator , <lgr> , of  x = y  is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q .
 This curve is of symbol  x = y  since it meets <lgr> , and hence every line of  x = y  in the  x = y  invariant points on <lgr> and since it obviously meets every line of  x = y  in a single point .
 The congruence of its secants is therefore of order  x = y  and class  x = y  .
 A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations : Since no two generators of  x = y  can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections .
 In other words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all .
 Now the only way in which all curves of the image family of  x = y  can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of  x = y  which is not a secant but a tangent of g , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of tangency .
 Since two curves of symbol  x = y  on Q intersect in  x = y  points , it follows that there are  x = y  lines of  x = y  which are tangent to g .
 Clearly , any line , l , of any bundle having one of these points of tangency , T , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of l and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of  x = y  which is tangent to g at T .
 A line through two of these points ,  x = y  and  x = y  , will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the tangents to g at  x = y  and  x = y  as directrices .
 A conic , C , being a (1,1) curve on Q , meets the image of any line of  x = y  , which we have already found to be a  x = y  curve on Q , in  x = y  points .
 Hence its image , C<prime> , meets any line of  x = y  in  x = y  points .
 Moreover , C<prime> obviously meets any line  x = y  in a single point .
 Hence C<prime> is a  x = y  curve on Q .
 Therefore , the congruence of its secants , that is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order  x = y  and class  x = y  .
 Finally , the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely  x = y  and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely  x = y  .
 The preceding observations make it clear that there exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve g .
 We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described .
 To do this we must first show that every line which meets g in a point P meets its image at P .
 To see this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of G .
 By (1) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order  x = y  which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order  x = y  .
 On C there is a  x = y  correspondence in which the  x = y  points cut from C by a general line , l , of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil .
 Since C is rational , this correspondence has k coincidences , each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image .
 However , since the pencil contains a secant of g it actually contains only  x = y  singular lines .
 To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that C be composite , with the secant of g and a curve of order  x = y  as components .
 Thus it follows that the secants of g are all invariant .
 But if this is the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point , P , of g as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order  x = y  having  x = y  generators concurrent at P .
 Since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent generators is necessarily a cone , it follows finally that every line through a point , P , of g meets its image at P , as asserted .
 Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , P , on g which is effected by the involution as a whole .
 From the preceding remarks , it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion .
 Moreover , in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order  x = y  , namely the cone of secants of g which pass through P .
 Hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de Jonquieres involution of order  x = y  and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either  x = y  or  x = y  .
 The first possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets g in  x = y  points ; the second requires that there be a line through P which meets g in  x = y  points .
 In each case , lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant .
 In the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the vertex , P , to the intersection of g and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant .
 In the second , the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex , P , to the two intersections of g and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant .
 The multiple secants , of course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order  x = y  .
 Observations similar to these can be made at each point of g .
 Hence g must have either a regulus of  x = y -fold secants or a regulus of  x = y -fold secants .
 Moreover , if  x = y  , no two of the multiple secants can intersect .
 For if such were the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet g in more than k points or , alternatively , the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high .
 But if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of g can intersect , then the regulus must be quadratic , or in other words , g must be either a  x = y  or a  x = y  curve on a nonsingular quadric surface .
 We now observe that the case in which g is a  x = y  curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet g .
 For any pencil in a plane containing a  x = y -fold secant of g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in  x = y  lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of g and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil .
 However , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely  x = y  .
 This contradicts the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that g is a  x = y  curve on a quadric surface .
 Continuing with the case in which g is a  x = y  curve on a quadric Q , we first observe that the second regulus of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of g and the planes through any one of the multiple secants .
 For each of these lines meets Q in three points , namely two points on g and one point on one of the multiple secants .
 Now consider an arbitrary line , l , meeting Q in two points ,  x = y  and  x = y  .
 If <agr> is the multiple secant of g which passes through  x = y  and <bgr> is the simple secant of g which passes through  x = y  , and if  x = y  are the points in which <agr> meets g , and if  x = y  is the image of  x = y  on the generator <bgr> , it follows that the image of the line  x = y  is  x = y  .
 These societies can expect to face difficult times .
 As the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction .
 National leaders will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity .
 Feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated  --  in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time  --  on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past .
 Nevertheless , with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped .
 The United States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible .
 Our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face .
 At the same time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts .
 It may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home .
 We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene .
 When necessary , we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development .
 As a nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community .
 When we look at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy .
 The men in power are committed in principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically .
 Isolated enterprises have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern .
 The society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two .
 Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted .
 Most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective .
 In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals .
 The colonial period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them  --  and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life .
 For example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement .
 The civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence .
 American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .
 We should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm .
 Above all , we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates .
 Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance .
 With respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see .
 Our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments .
 We should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected .
 Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field relates to national progress .
 Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development .
 To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account .
 If modernization programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties .
 Land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries .
 It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society .
 As an isolated policy , land reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance .
 It should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy can not be solved by administrative decrees alone .
 Land reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture .
 Lastly , governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead .
 By holding out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth .
 At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth .
 They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups .
 But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies .
 On the economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources .
 Several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved .
 These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy .
 They must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years .
 Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward .
 Capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning .
 Finally , a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance of payments support .
 Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange .
 There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved .
 For one thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects ; even the famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken .
 Technical assistance in training middle  --  and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases .
 There are also more basic problems .
 This is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people .
 Nevertheless , impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices .
 Another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism .
 The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West .
 Particularly when based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest .
 Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies .
 American policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes .
 It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies .
 We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways .
 We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time .
 With the exception of treaty-making , foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration .
 Foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection .
 American and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must generate .
 It follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon .
 It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark .
 This condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid .
 The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it .
 In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex .
 With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion .
 Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions .
 Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences .
 If the inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows .
 There are several closely related inner functions .
 In the last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man's deepest experience  --  the religious .
 Man is first religious ; the instrumentalities follow .
 Religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence .
 The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self-pacification , and self-completion .
 The chief experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power .
 Related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe .
 Man has the experience of being helpfully allied with what he can not fully understand ; he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement .
 The universe is a safe and permanent home .
 A number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal .
 Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance ; man has a second chance .
 He is not lost in the abyss of endless time ; he has endless being .
 Religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit .
 Religion can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideals and values  --  ethical , aesthetic , and religious  --  of man formed in his culture .
 There is also the possibility , among higher religions , of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness .
 The kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not only provides , clarifies , and relates human yearnings , values , ideals , and purposes ; it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness .
 Under the religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; life leads somewhere .
 Religion at its best is out in front , ever beckoning and leading on , and , as Lippman put it , "mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance"  .
 At the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him .
 It gives him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate .
 He is confronted with the recurrent crises , such as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life  --  marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old age , the certainty of death .
 He has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie .
 His religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger .
 Religion usually also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state .
 The belief in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here and now .
 The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance .
 The feeling of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies .
 In providing for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution .
 In addition to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society .
 The two have never been separable .
 Religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation .
 The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions .
 The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values .
 Even in the United States , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values .
 This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere ; for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism .
 In America also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion .
 Even the non-church members  --  the freewheelers , marginal religionists and so on  --  have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them .
 Furthermore , religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; for example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends .
 Finally , it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super-empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; for example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument .
 It places certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering .
 Closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends .
 This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends ; for example , a plan that fulfills the will of God , which advances the Kingdom of God , which involves social life as part of the Grand Design .
 This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy .
 It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action .
 Finally , it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life .
 In general , there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends .
 Religion integrates and unifies .
 Some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion .
 These groups have varied widely from mere families , primitive , totemic groups , and small modern cults and sects , to the memberships of great denominations , and great , widely dispersed world religions .
 Religion fosters group life in various ways .
 The common ultimate values , ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor .
 Without a system of values there can be no society .
 Where such a value system prevails , it always unifies all who possess it ; it enables members of the society to operate as a system .
 The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds , dogmas , and doctrines , and form what Durkheim calls a credo .
 As he points out , a religious group can not exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong is the group .
 The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group .
 The religious symbolism , and especially the closely related rites and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith .
 The religion , in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large .
 The common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together .
 These are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior .
 The codes are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group .
 Durkheim noted long ago that religion as "... a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things ... unite[s] into one single moral community ... all those who adhere to them"  .
 His view is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit .
 This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United States ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds .
 The unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized .
 The Jews for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion are cases in point .
 It might be pointed out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings  --  political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic .
 Religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving function .
 As such it acts as an anchor for the people .
 There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance .
 It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones .
 It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living .
 As Yinger has pointed out , the "... reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future"  .
 Historically , religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions .
 At the same time that religion exercises a conserving influence , it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups .
 Much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives .
 The great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices ; for example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars .
 Much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion .
 The insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects .
 Religion provides the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide by its norms , but who engage in good works .
 Religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control , enforcing what men should or should not do .
 Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; and in modern societies such influence is still great .
 Religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now .
 Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong .
 Thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem .
 The result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated .
 Soon Mrs. B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family .
 Inability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation .
 Clearly , this was a family in crisis .
 Mrs. B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying .
 Her previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday .
 On the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral .
 In the family's own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had "reached the crisis peak  --  either the situation will give or we will break"  !
 Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs. B.'s anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears of annihilation .
 Abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , abandonment , and annihilation , produced further relief of tension .
 In a joint interview Mr. and Mrs. B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins .
 The father , accurately perceiving the child's needs , not only respected them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins , saying , "I have a big lap ; there is room for you , too , Johnnie"  .
 Simultaneously , a variety of environmental supports  --  a calm but not too motherly homemaker , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing care , accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins' feeding problem  --  combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms .
 Follow-up visits of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's day-to-day mental health and social functioning .
 As seen in the B. family , there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance .
 The lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety , often assuming the superficial guise of "not knowing"  or "not caring"  .
 The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference .
 In general , the approach is more active than passive , more out-reaching than reflective .
 While some regression is inevitable , it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy .
 To establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meeting the client's specific needs .
 These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension .
 The initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense .
 In this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem .
 In so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact .
 Thus , the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf .
 Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation .
 We are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue regression , unhealthy suppression and repression , excessive use of denial , and crippling guilt turned against the self .
 While some suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the worker's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed .
 In steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive responses , the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques of specific emotional support , clarification , and anticipatory guidance .
 Over a relatively short period of time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back and forth , between immediate external stressful exigencies ( "precipitating stress"  ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues ( "underlying problem"  ) which are , often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough , reactivated by the crisis situation , and hence once again amenable to resolution .
 Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments .
 Then , too , the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone follow-up calls , if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention .
 In addition , in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources  --  homemaker , day care , medical and financial aid  --  must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts .
 At certain critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating .
 While expensive in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in terms of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client's life ) , techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives .
 Finally , whatever the techniques used , a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service : to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities .
 Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : What place should brief , crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services ?
 We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum , each important in its own right .
 This problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself .
 Almost three decades ago Bertha Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services .
 Her conclusion has been borne out in the experience of many practitioners : "... short-contact interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work"  .
 Thus , casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended .
 That we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature .
 Especially noteworthy is Levinger's finding that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome .
 According to a number of studies , the important predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as well as the accessibility of the helping person .
 For example , the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project .
 Of startling significance , too , is the assertion that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services .
 These reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people .
 Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship , quick appraisal of key issues , and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses .
 While there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's initial need for help .
 In some programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success .
 Willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) is another prominent feature in these efforts .
 My aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to "wild therapy"  but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride .
 Though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary  --  or perhaps , in some instances , primary  --  level , the place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number of investigators in a wide variety of settings .
 Woodward , for example , has emphasized the "need for a broad spectrum of services , including very brief services in connection with critical situations"  .
 Ideally , brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance .
 Moreover , the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available  --  and on a more effective basis to more people .
 Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services  --  including attempts to develop a typology of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches  --  and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners .
 Our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian .
 Probably , in the immediate future , we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models .
 Increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies , especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services , holds rich promise for the future .
 For example , child welfare experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships .
 DAN MORGAN TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD FORGET Ann Turner .
 He was well rid of her .
 He certainly did n't want a wife who was fickle as Ann .
 If he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble .
 But all of this was rationalization .
 Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep .
 His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing .
 The easiest thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that would n't allow it .
 The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work .
 He found that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake .
 Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant .
 He had plenty of work to do .
 Because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years .
 The grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here .
 He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows .
 He had no idea how much time Budd would give him .
 In any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence .
 He stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm .
 When , in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle .
 It could be some kind of trick Budd had thought up .
 No one walked in this country , least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew .
 Morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled .
 When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever .
 He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started downstream .
 His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house .
 Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet .
 Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands .
 They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty .
 They were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door .
 She lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet .
 The boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring .
 Morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one .
 He did n't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending .
 The boy licked his dry lips .
 He asked , "Could we have a drink"  ?
 Morgan jerked his head toward the front door .
 "In the kitchen"  , he said .
 Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl .
 "Get up . There's water in the house"  .
 .
 She did n't move or say anything .
 Her eyes were glazed as if she did n't hear or even see him .
 She had reached a point at which she did n't even care how she looked .
 Her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry .
 Her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection .
 It must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding .
 He picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house .
 She was amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he was n't even sure she was conscious .
 Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled .
 No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him .
 Besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him .
 He put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table .
 They looked a good deal alike , Morgan thought .
 Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features .
 Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth .
 She drank greedily , and murmured , "Thank you"  , as he lowered her head .
 He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition .
 He had seen a few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two .
 The girl dropped off to sleep .
 Morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove .
 He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy .
 "Who are you and what happened to you"  ?
 he asked .
 "I'm Billy Jones"  , the boy answered .
 "That's my wife Sharon . We ran out of money and we have n't eaten for two days"  .
 .
 "What are you doing here"  ?
 "Are we in Wyoming"  ?
 Morgan nodded .
 "About five miles north of the line"  .
 Jones sighed as if relieved .
 "We've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down"  .
 "You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work"  ?
 Morgan demanded .
 "The town of Buckhorn's only about six miles from here . Why did n't you go there"  .
 ?
 "We did n't want town work"  , Jones said .
 "This is a mighty empty country"  , Morgan said .
 "There's only one more ranch three miles north of here . You'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places"  .
 .
 "Then we're lucky we got here . Could you give us a job , Mr. ..."  .
 "Morgan . Dan Morgan"  .
 .
 He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple .
 They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house .
 He dismissed the possibility at once .
 The girl's thin face haunted him .
 It was n't the face of a killer .
 He was n't so sure about the boy .
 He had n't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression .
 There was more to this than Jones had told him .
 They were running from something .
 He'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he could n't send them on , either .
 "I could use some help"  , Morgan said finally , "but I ca n't afford to pay you anything . I guess you'd better go on in the morning"  .
 .
 "We'll work for our keep"  , the boy said eagerly .
 "I've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to work on a ranch . Sharon , she's cooked in a restaurant . We'll work hard , Mr. Morgan"  .
 .
 "I'll see"  , Morgan said .
 "Right now you need a meal and a bath . Your wife's in terrible shape"  .
 .
 "I know"  , Jones said dejectedly .
 Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table .
 When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl .
 He said , "I've got some supper ready"  .
 She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair .
 "I'm a mess"  , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed .
 "Who are you ?
 How did we get here"  ?
 "I'm Dan Morgan . This is the Rafter M . You fell down in front of the house , and I carried you in . I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep"  .
 .
 "Oh"  .
 She stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; then she murmured : "You're very kind , Mr. Morgan . Do you take in all the strays who come by"  .
 ?
 "I do n't have many strays coming to my front door"  , he said .
 "Think you can walk to the table"  ?
 "Of course"  .
 She got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell .
 He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen .
 She sat down at the table , shaking her head .
 "I'm sorry , Mr. Morgan . I'm usually a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired"  .
 .
 "And hungry"  , he said .
 "Start in . It's not much of a meal , but it's what I eat"  .
 .
 "Not much of a meal"  ?
 the girl cried .
 "Mr. Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw"  .
 He told himself he had never seen two people eat so much .
 When they were finally satisfied , Jones said , "I think he's going to give us work"  .
 The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself .
 When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he could n't send them on .
 She said , "I guess the Lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents"  .
 Morgan laughed .
 "Which are you"  ?
 "We're not drunkards"  , she said .
 "That's all I'm sure of"  .
 She helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark .
 He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall .
 He said : "You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath . Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones . You'll have to go to town to see the doc"  .
 .
 "No , she'll be all right"  , Jones said quickly .
 "I mean , we do n't have any way to get there and we ca n't expect you to quit work just to take us to town"  .
 "We'll see"  , Morgan said .
 "Could you find me a needle and thread"  ?
 the girl asked .
 "My dress needs some work on it"  .
 He nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors .
 He said : "I'm going to bed"  .
 He nodded at the door in front of him .
 "That's my spare bedroom . The bed is n't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there"  .
 .
 "You're awfully kind"  , the girl said .
 "We'll pay you back if you'll let us . Some way"  .
 .
 "It's all right"  , he said .
 "I get up early . You'd better sleep"  .
 .
 Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him .
 He said : "If it's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I'll sleep out here on the couch . We have n't slept together since we started . I just ca n't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together ..."  .
 He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , "I understand that , but I do n't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place"  .
 "We got fired"  , Jones said .
 "We had to do something"  .
 They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed .
 Gavin paused wearily .
 "You ca n't stay here with me . It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn"  .
 .
 "You ca n't make me go"  .
 Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .
 He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide .
 It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .
 Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .
 Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .
 Against that other man he could rally his anger ; against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .
 Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words .
 "Do you remember Big Charlie"  ?
 he whispered .
 "He stuck with me all these years . Just a half-breed'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me . He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son . It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it  --  Big Charlie told me so . I believed him . They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago . My men , they all left me . Just cleared out . I did n't understand why , Clay . They just all cleared out . I treated them fair ..."  .
 He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder .
 "Do you mean"   --  he asked almost shyly  --  "you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin"  ?
 "Yes"  .
 "You do n't hate me any more"  ?
 Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , "No"  .
 "Come here"  .
 The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him .
 Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely .
 "All my life"  , he said , "I tried . I tried . I saw you driftin away  --  but I tried . And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give . Now there's nothin left of me . Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead  --  and you come to me , to help me . Oh !
 God in Heaven , I ca n't refuse you now . That would mock me too much !
 Ca n't let you go way from me again ..."  .
 He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears .
 "I'll go , Clay"  .
 Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
 The eyes followed him fearfully .
 "The horses . There is n't much time . I'll saddle the horses and bring them round . You get ready"  .
 .
 He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .
 Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words .
 When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .
 The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .
 Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .
 The mare had backed away .
 "You take it easy , boy"  , Clayton whispered .
 "She does n't want you now . You take it easy , your time will come"  .
 .
 Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure .
 He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor .
 Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .
 "Clay"  , he said , "where are we goin"  ?
 "To a ranch in the valley . There's someone there I have to see . We may take her with us  --  to California . I do n't know yet , it's crazy ; I have to think about it . But California is where we're goin"  .
 .
 "California"  .
 Gavin began to nod .
 "That's a new land . A man could make a mark there . Two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been . Start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened"  .
 .
 "Yes , like a father and son"  .
 "I made you what you are"  , Gavin whispered .
 "I made you so you could stand up . I made you a man"  .
 .
 "Yes , Gavin , you did"  .
 He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck .
 "Help me up , Clay . Help me up , I feel kind of stiff"  .
 .
 Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .
 "I hate to leave my garden"  , Gavin said .
 "They'll trample it down . I loved my garden"  .
 .
 "It will grow again  --  in California"  .
 "I loved this valley"  , he whispered huskily .
 "Lived alone here for three years , before any man came . Lived alone by the river . It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet . There was no one but me . I do n't want to leave it"  .
 .
 Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump .
 The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness .
 THEY RODE at a measured pace through the valley .
 Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .
 The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .
 It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind  --  a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men .
 Gavin sighed bitterly .
 In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .
 He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .
 In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life .
 The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .
 They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .
 Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .
 A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .
 The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .
 THEY HAD been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .
 The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .
 The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy .
 But the liquor had flushed their courage .
 They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose .
 Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .
 He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .
 "He's leavin . That's what you wanted , is n't it ?
 Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley . You ca n't"  .
 "Keep out of this"  , Purvis snarled .
 "He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son . You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone"  .
 .
 Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .
 First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .
 He remembered Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence .
 Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap .
 His wife had said to him : "Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy . He would n't even dance with her at Gavin's party . He treats her like she was dirt . And you stand by like a fool and let him do it ..."  .
 He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .
 It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .
 "You're Gavin's son"  , Joe Purvis had said .
 He turned to Lester .
 "You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy . He meant to help Gavin all the time . He made a fool of you , Lester"  .
 .
 He swung round to the other men  --  "We can catch him easy !
 There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place . If we let them go , they wo n't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back . There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap  --  if we ride hard we can take them"  .
 .
 Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder .
 The boy jerked away .
 "He killed Tom  --  do you understand that"  ?
 Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night .
 He fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light .
 Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .
 They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .
 IN THE cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear .
 The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow .
 When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line .
 The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind .
 The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .
 He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .
 They neither gained nor fell back .
 He rode low on the mare's neck .
 Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no more than a mile away .
 Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .
 He did not look back ; he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north .
 He knew who was riding after him  --  the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him .
 Now they were riding to kill him .
 And he was fleeing , running  --  fleeing his death and his life at the same time .
 The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .
 With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again .
 The Gap looming before him  --  the place where he had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago  --  was his exit from all that had meaning to him .
 California is too far , he thought .
 He would never reach California .
 He was too old  --  when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .
 The sentry was not dead .
 He was , in fact , showing signs of reviving .
 He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol .
 A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard .
 He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat .
 Mike stripped these from him and donned them .
 He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose .
 They dragged him inside the building .
 Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet .
 Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him .
 "You are hurt"  !
 she breathed .
 "I never felt better in my life"  , Fiske blustered .
 He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek .
 "Thank you , my dear"  , he said .
 "You are very brave"  .
 Mike silenced them .
 "We'll talk later . First , we've got to get out of here"  .
 .
 "We'll grab horses"  , Dean said .
 "The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall"  .
 Mike debated it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride .
 But it at least offered him a chance for living .
 He had none here .
 And , for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried .
 The guerrilla bivouac remained silent .
 Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground .
 Someone evidently was on duty there .
 No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .
 About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight .
 Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency .
 He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske .
 "Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride"  , he said .
 "We'll stampede the rest . You stay with the ladies . All of you be ready to ride hell for leather"  .
 .
 He added , "If this does n't work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them"  .
 He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .
 Susan halted Dean and kissed him .
 She clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes .
 Mike turned away .
 He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss had n't meant what he had believed it had .
 He felt unutterably weary .
 Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms .
 He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness .
 She too began to weep .
 He released her and joined Mike .
 "All right"  , he said .
 Mike only said , "Later"  .
 "Be careful , McLish"  !
 Susan said fiercely .
 "The way you were careful"  ?
 he snorted .
 "Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock"  ?
 He kept going .
 He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her .
 He might say or do something foolish .
 Something all of them would regret .
 He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her .
 And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride .
 He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol .
 "Stay well back of me"  , he said .
 "I'm going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas . There's bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close"  .
 .
 Holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade .
 It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings .
 One wing stood open .
 Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .
 They were tethered , army style , on stable lines .
 A voice spoke near-at-hand .
 "Who's that"  ?
 "Just me"  , Mike said .
 "Is that you , Bill"  ?
 He located his man .
 The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight .
 Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch .
 Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol .
 But the luck that had been running their way left him .
 The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle .
 He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .
 Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded .
 The bullet went wide .
 Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash .
 This time it connected solidly on the man's temple , felling him .
 The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills .
 The startled horses began rearing on their tethers .
 Dean came rushing up .
 "Are you hit"  ?
 he demanded .
 "No , but the fat's in the fire"  !
 Mike said .
 "There's no chance now of all of us getting away . You'll have to try it alone"  .
 .
 The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need .
 Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line .
 "Up you go"  !
 he said .
 "Ride"  !
 Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse .
 "Why not you"  ?
 he protested .
 "Dammit"  !
 Mike said frantically .
 "You're lighter than me . It's our only chance now . Try to find these Feds . The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back . You're the one that's taking the big chance"  .
 .
 Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand .
 "No telling how good this horse is"  , Mike panted .
 "Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble . Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight . Take the pistol . You might need it . We'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more . I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they ca n't chase you"  .
 .
 Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back .
 "McLish"  , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , "I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again"  .
 Then he was on his way at a gallop .
 Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet .
 He lifted a screeching war whoop .
 That touched off a total stampede .
 He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there .
 These poured through the gate and joined the flight .
 The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges .
 The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure .
 "'Paches" !
 Mike yelled .
 "They're stealin' the stock"  !
 He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings .
 He crouched there .
 His shout had been taken up and repeated .
 The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses .
 All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all .
 Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .
 They had pistols in their hands .
 They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .
 They followed the others toward the east gate .
 Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches .
 Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings .
 He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .
 The area was deserted .
 A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade .
 Mike crawled to the door and peered in .
 The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
 A lantern hung from a peg , giving light .
 Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner .
 A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches .
 An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges .
 Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty .
 Shouldering the load he peered from the door .
 His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas .
 He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration .
 He set his bundle down .
 Snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post .
 He picked up the powder canister and ran out .
 Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it .
 He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon .
 He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .
 Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon .
 The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him .
 They realized the truth .
 Bullets began to snap past him .
 One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack .
 Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again .
 A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety .
 Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .
 Guerrillas were racing toward him .
 Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them .
 The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap .
 Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .
 She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks .
 Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak .
 The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars .
 Mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet .
 He hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls .
 He peered from a loophole .
 Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house .
 Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired .
 He dropped a man with the first bullet .
 At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit .
 That halted the rush .
 The guerrillas scattered for cover .
 The wagons were burning fiercely .
 The mudwagon had caught fire also .
 The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .
 The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .
 "Gawdamighty"  !
 one screeched .
 "There goes our grub an' ammunition"  !
 "Get a bucket line going"  !
 Calhoun shouted .
 "Hurry !
 Hurry"  !
 The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring .
 But what few containers they found were inadequate .
 Many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort .
 Both buildings were in flames .
 The heat drove the guerrillas back .
 The roof of the command post began to buckle .
 "Drag the wagons to the spring"  !
 Lew Durkin yelled .
 "Run'em right into the spring !
 Hustle"  !
 One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame .
 A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .
 The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .
 The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound .
 The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor .
 But it had missed the bone and had passed on through .
 Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury .
 Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it .
 "So it was n't the earthquake that made him return to his village"  !
 "No . Now dammit , I do n't want to go into any more explanations . Here comes Jason . Keep this to yourself"  .
 .
 Reverend Jason , looking worried , hurried toward us .
 "Anything wrong , cap'n ?
 The men seem to think so"  .
 "Dirion found a large war party south of us . They'll probably attack at dawn"  .
 , Montero said .
 He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp .
 Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , "Fort up !
 Fort up !
 There's a large war party on their way"  !
 For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb .
 Then Little Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal .
 They all flew into action .
 "That was a terrible thing to do"  , I said to Oso .
 "The Aricaras treated us like friends . And here all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them !
 God , what a world you people live in"  .
 .
 Oso gave me an unruffled look .
 "Old Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river"  , he said calmly .
 "What would you have done in Montero's moccasins ?
 Let Old Knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else"  ?
 He shook his head .
 "Mr. Manuel did that in the war . That's why the British never got the tribes to fight for the King . Mr. Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid'em for their horses . Then he went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up . He did that with all the Nations . Hell , they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else . The War Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero . I saw that letter . He carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin"  .
 .
 "But that was war"  , I said .
 "There's no war on now"  .
 "You're wrong , Matt . In this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green . First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites . And it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land"  .
 .
 I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight .
 "That's why this company's important . Once we get over the mountains others will come along . That's why the Trust do n't want us to make it . That bastard Chambers !
  --  Old Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work !
 Before we get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods . Well , talkin' ai n't goin' to help  --  let's fort up"  .
 !
 As I dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company .
 For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet .
 More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .
 Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods .
 Surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done .
 In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river .
 "I think Montero did right"  , Amy said firmly .
 "Let the savages kill each other . What do we care"  .
 ?
 Reverend Jason was understandably bitter .
 "It was a terrible thing to do . Those little children ..."  .
 .
 But Oso replied calmly , "Trouble ai n't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend"  .
 GRAY EYES ATTACKED OUR camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky .
 Our camp was in the center of a wide valley .
 Montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush .
 He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire .
 The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible .
 Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors .
 The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day .
 Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered .
 The worst part had been the waiting ; although we did n't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless .
 Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl .
 Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; I did n't catch a wink .
 Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife .
 It was a relief when they finally came .
 They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry .
 "Oso"  , Montero called "I'll get Gray Eyes"  .
 "That'll be a pleasure to see"  , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle .
 "Hold your fire"  , Montero was shouting .
 "Wait until my shot . I'll shoot the first man who does n't"  .
 .
 I could see them in my sights .
 They were about a mile off ; under me the ground quivered slightly .
 At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads .
 Gradually they emerged as men .
 Gray Eyes was in the lead .
 His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest .
 He was naked except for a clout .
 Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions .
 His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams .
 I found his chest in my sights .
 It had a red circle .
 The circle came nearer and nearer .
 My God , how long is he going to wait , I thought ... .
 Montero's rifle cracked .
 At first I thought he had missed .
 Gray Eyes remained erect .
 The feathered lance was still above his head .
 As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse .
 I squeezed the trigger .
 At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .
 I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball .
 He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing .
 He jerked once in the grass and lay still .
 "If you're goin' to kill'em  --  kill'em"  !
 Oso growled .
 What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides .
 The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated .
 "Lead up !
 Lead up !
 They'll be back"  !
 Montero was shouting .
 Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing .
 Out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses .
 The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder .
 A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy .
 A rifle cracked ; the square head fell over .
 One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek .
 His legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him .
 There was a ragged volley .
 He was dead before he hit the ground .
 "For Christ's sake , do n't waste your powder on one of'em"  !
 Montero shouted furiously .
 "Wait for the charge !
 The charge , I tell you"  !
 The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .
 They grew louder as the Indians charged again .
 I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries .
 "Gray Eyes is back"  , Montero said .
 The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat .
 I could see the blood running down his chest .
 He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump .
 I forgot to aim .
 In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .
 Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; there was no doubt he was dying .
 Again we waited for Montero .
 This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire .
 The horses were only several lengths away when he fired .
 The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse .
 Our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts .
 But a few reached our wall .
 I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray .
 I saw Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone .
 A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it did n't seem possible they were in flight .
 Men screamed .
 Oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck .
 Other Indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets .
 Reverend Jason got one , the Canadians the others .
 I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position .
 The ponies were almost uncontrollable .
 The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again .
 This time more of them hurdled the barrier .
 A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt .
 It sounded like a man kicking a melon .
 Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales .
 Although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me .
 I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil .
 His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in .
 Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil .
 Now under me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint ... .
 The Aricaras made one last desperate charge .
 It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses .
 Others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs .
 Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts ... .
 None of them reached our walls again .
 The few survivors grudgingly turned away .
 In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .
 She was carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist .
 "I saw your fire"  , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger .
 "You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size . It would n't matter to a fool like you . It would to me"  .
 .
 "All right"  , Wilson said quickly .
 "The fire's too big . And I appreciate the advice"  .
 .
 He was losing patience again .
 An hour before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company .
 She had helped him change his mind .
 "I'm not advising you"  , she said .
 "I'm telling you . That fire's too big . Let it burn down . And make sure it's out when you leave in the morning"  .
 .
 He was taken aback .
 It took him a long time to compose himself .
 "There's some mistake"  , he said finally .
 "You're right about the fire . It's bigger than it has to be , though I do n't see where it's doing any harm . But you're wrong about the rest of it . I'm not leaving in the morning . Why should I ?
 I own the place"  .
 .
 She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face .
 It did n't seem to tell her anything .
 She glanced around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight .
 She studied it for a long time .
 Then she turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he was n't quite sure what she meant by it .
 "You own this place"  ?
 she said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .
 "You bought it"  ?
 "From a man in St. Louis"  , Wilson said .
 "Jake Carwood . Maybe you know him"  .
 .
 The girl laughed .
 "I know him . I ought to . My father ran him off here six years ago"  .
 .
 Wilson did n't say anything .
 He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .
 She had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him .
 "Carwood did n't tell you that"  , she said .
 "No"  , Wilson said .
 "But it's understandable . It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of . And it does n't make any difference . He sold me a clear title . I have it with me , right here . If you want to see"  .
 "Never mind"  , she said sternly .
 "It would n't matter to my father , and not to me . I meant what I said about that fire . Be sure it's out when you leave . That's all . I'll let you go back to doing the dishes now"  .
 .
 It was meant to insult him , and did n't quite succeed .
 He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now .
 "I do n't mind washing dishes now and then"  , he said pleasantly .
 "It does n't hurt . It might hurt you , though . Somebody might mistake you for a woman"  .
 .
 He meant to say more , but he never got the chance .
 She was quick .
 She brought the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back .
 She swung the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle .
 She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall .
 He grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him .
 It made him a little sick , and he let go of her .
 He got up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her .
 He wiped the blood from his cheek .
 "I ought to"   --  he said .
 He was shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps .
 "That quirt  --  I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good . If you were a man"  .
 "She is n't , mister"  .
 The voice came from behind him , and Wilson turned .
 The fire had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees .
 But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him .
 He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought .
 And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek .
 "She's not a man , mister"  , he said .
 "I am . If you've got any ideas"  .
 .
 He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest .
 "Put the rifle down , Joseph"  , the girl said .
 She seemed irritated .
 "I thought I told you to stay home"  .
 The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap .
 The scar looked pure white in the half-darkness ; his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless .
 "You should n't be riding up here after dark , Judith"  , he said quietly .
 "I can take care of this . It's no job for you"  .
 .
 The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him .
 He took it without flinching .
 "I said go home , Joseph . You've got no business up here"  .
 .
 The half-breed did n't answer this time .
 But the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry .
 It made Wilson wonder .
 He watched the half-breed as he turned silently .
 They could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out .
 Wilson brushed the dust from his coat .
 "Who was that"  ?
 he asked .
 "Your personal guard ?
 You're pretty hard on him"  .
 "He works for my father"  , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind .
 "He's a friend . His name's Joseph Sanchez . Is there anything else you want to know"  .
 ?
 "Not now"  , Wilson said .
 "I guess I'll find out soon enough . You've got blood on your cheek . Not yours . Mine . It must have got there when you fell against me"  .
 .
 She wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat .
 "I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby"  , Wilson said .
 He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist .
 "Oh , no"  , he said , and he was without humor now .
 "I've had enough of that . I've had enough of you . I do n't know what goes on around here , and I do n't care . I do n't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I do n't care about that , either . You took me by surprise . But I'll know how to handle you next time"  .
 .
 She brought up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker .
 He side-stepped her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding .
 She finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle .
 Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .
 He had forgotten that she was so pretty .
 But her prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will .
 He had known women like that , one woman in particular .
 And one had been too many .
 He watched the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he could n't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping .
 They were n't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending .
 He had n't shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman .
 They expected greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed .
 And determined not to show it .
 They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed .
 "Go to sleep"  , he said .
 "Both of you . There's better things to do than listen to something like that . I'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me"  .
 .
 He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .
 The coyote was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it .
 Not tonight , at any rate .
 He had a feeling that the girl meant trouble .
 If she did , he could stand it better in the light .
 He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out .
 That afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high .
 Already some of the pain had gone from Amelia's death .
 Not all of it .
 There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief .
 But they were starting a new life .
 And they had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses .
 The land was n't all Wilson had expected of it .
 Six hundred and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; good grass , good water .
 Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it .
 The water was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard .
 And there was a house ; livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs .
 In the last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain .
 The place had been cheap  --  just the little he had left after Amelia's burial  --  and it would serve its purpose .
 There was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet .
 It had n't started out that way .
 And he had a feeling  --  thanks to the girl  --  that things would get worse before they got better .
 They had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses .
 He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him .
 Kathy was already in the wagon .
 They were going to town , and they were both excited .
 Wilson backed the team into the traces , and wished they were n't going to town at all .
 He had an uneasy feeling about it .
 That girl last night , what was her name ?
 Judith Pierce .
 It was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember .
 He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him .
 He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem .
 There was brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle would n't stop to graze .
 But there was water .
 There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard .
 Yes , there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble .
 There were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres .
 The first part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley .
 It was hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better .
 A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .
 A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road .
 It took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville .
 The town was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel ; all dusty and sunbaked .
 The place was quiet .
 Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all .
 I was nearly thirty at the time .
 I went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters .
 It was dark and , I sensed , very large ; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it .
 Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness .
 I would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded .
 A glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most .
 Drifting here and there .
 Squatting , as if waiting .
 The pulsing glow of a cigarette .
 Since they could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me .
 The clerk paid them no attention .
 This impressed me , until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence .
 His job simply consisted in registering new men .
 When the phone rang he answered it .
 His authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further .
 None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him .
 Baldness was attacking his pate .
 He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .
 He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath .
 It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was .
 But it was not easy for him and he often slipped .
 When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced .
 I felt certain he was really a spineless little man .
 His hat ( the cause of his baldness ?
 ) hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it I could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck .
 The morning's tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines .
 On a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music .
 Everything about the clerk was trivial .
 Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall .
 Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person .
 With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air .
 When he saw me coming he turned his radio off .
 He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .
 He would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance .
 What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me .
 In the mornings , I was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall .
 They , and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office .
 He pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words .
 I was shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning .
 Now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand .
 He could n't afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said .
 Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient .
 I withdrew my hand .
 Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket .
 Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself .
 When suitably lighted , what would it look like ?
 The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air .
 One afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall .
 By counting the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time .
 For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended .
 I could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison .
 I had for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself .
 I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell .
 It was , I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light .
 This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below .
 Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder .
 No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention .
 And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently .
 This sort of petty vigilance annoyed me .
 I felt certain it was self-appointed .
 It sprang from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here .
 I decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed .
 I felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance .
 I lived in a state of suspense because of it .
 I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to .
 I had signed it off on the forms .
 My future lay solely with the hall , yet what did I know about the hall at this point ?
 Although I had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning .
 I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing .
 I did not despair , however ; far from it !
 I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall .
 Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me .
 Large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted .
 The river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it .
 Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs .
 The sounds issuing from beyond  --  winches whirring , men shouting  --  indicated great activity and excited me .
 The hall , on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons .
 It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before .
 Its front was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street .
 I kept circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall .
 But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it .
 For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there .
 I returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk .
 As I had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application .
 Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer .
 At last , when I put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual .
 When I asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall .
 I could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o'clock .
 The clerk impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock .
 When I went for my interview with the director I saw why .
 Although it was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people .
 Cigarette butts littered the floor .
 The big fans were going , drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling .
 I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs .
 The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men .
 I stopped by the counter .
 No one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office I noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open .
 Past it I could see part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor .
 The director's office .
 I rapped my knuckles on the counter .
 The director came to the door .
 I was at once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained .
 He was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar .
 He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment .
 But he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application .
 I had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times .
 He did not look at them now .
 As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall .
 He spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance .
 Why had I registered ?
 Begging my pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall .
 He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them .
 Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for ?
 What sort of men I would come into contact with , at the hall ?
 These questions did not surprise me ; I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place .
 Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying .
 I had always , I said , hankered after working hard with my hands .
 This desire , I went on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing .
 To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence .
 The flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head .
 "Tie him up"  .
 "Hell with it"  .
 Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard .
 The man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor .
 Barton said harshly , "Why did you do that"  ?
 Rankin sneered at him .
 "What did you want me to do , kiss him ?
 He dumped me in solitary twice"  .
 Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around .
 "Let's get one thing straight , you and me . The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out . If you ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you"  .
 Fred Rankin looked at him .
 It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him , the thin-lipped smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now .
 "Come on . Let's move"  .
 They filed out through the guard-room door , into the paved square .
 There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks .
 There was no chance .
 They moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall .
 There was no moon .
 They had chosen this night purposely .
 They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and Powers slipped through the door .
 Two men were on duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed .
 They looked up in surprise as Powers came in .
 "What are you doing out of the block"  ?
 "It's Curtiss"  , he said , naming the man Rankin had hit .
 "I've got to have help"  .
 They stared at him .
 The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet .
 "What's wrong with him"  ?
 "He's having some kind of a fit"  .
 The sergeant turned to the door .
 As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side .
 "One sound and you're dead"  .
 The sergeant froze .
 Powers had not followed .
 Powers was covering the remaining guard .
 The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell .
 Powers knocked his arm aside .
 Deliberately , with none of Rankin's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head .
 They were free .
 Even Barton could not quite believe it .
 It had gone without a hitch .
 They slid through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground .
 Five minutes later they reached the horses .
 Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts .
 He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short .
 No one hurried .
 They walked the horses , heading along the river , Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night .
 The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts .
 Five miles .
 In a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees .
 Foster had brought extra clothing also .
 A good man , Emmett .
 He had been one of the original Night Riders , one who had escaped the trial .
 It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison .
 Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt .
 Kid Boyd was unusually silent , Rankin watchful , a few paces apart .
 Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers .
 "I wo n't even try to thank you"  .
 The ex-prison guard was embarrassed .
 He said in a studied voice , "I did n't do it for you . I did it for the valley . You're the only man the Night Riders will follow . We've been starving and I do n't like to starve"  .
 Barton turned away , his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse .
 "Good luck"  .
 The murderer lifted his head .
 "Meaning you want me to ride out"  ?
 "You are n't one of us . There's nothing for you here"  .
 "I got no place to go"  .
 Barton hesitated .
 He did not trust Rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct .
 But ten years in prison had taught him realities .
 They were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money .
 It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night Riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure .
 But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side .
 "Your choice"  , he said briefly , and turned to Kid Boyd .
 "Bury those uniforms so they wo n't be found"  .
 Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off , up the river bank .
 He wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley .
 They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently .
 He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco .
 Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled .
 Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly .
 For his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell .
 Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man .
 He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money .
 He had done time for the theft .
 The one thing they had in common was their hatred .
 Both hated Donald Kruger .
 It had drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape .
 He said now , "I've got the perfect headquarters set up . The old Haskell mine"  .
 Mitch Barton knew the place .
 Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley .
 They had spent a million dollars , carving in a road , putting up buildings , drilling their haulage tunnel .
 Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned .
 "The road's washed badly"  , said Dill , "but there's a trail you can get over with a horse . A company of cavalry could n't come in there if two men were guarding that trail"  .
 Barton nodded .
 "How do the valley people feel"  ?
 "As mad as ever . But Kruger's men keep them off balance , and they do n't trust me . I'm an outsider . When they learn you're in the hills though , they'll rally , do n't worry about that"  .
 Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind .
 "My boy . Did you find him"  ?
 Dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension .
 "He's in Morgan's Ferry"  .
 Barton half-straightened in surprise .
 "What's he doing there"  ?
 Again Dill hesitated .
 "Dealing faro"  .
 "Dealing faro ?
 How come"  ?
 "Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon"  .
 Barton cursed under his breath .
 After another long pause he asked , "How many people know who they are"  ?
 "Everyone . Your cousin Finley saw to that . He's quite a rat , you know . He sold out to Kruger's men . He's informed them of everything you've ever written him . He wants your ranch"  .
 Barton stood up .
 He said tensely , "All right . Let's go get the boy"  .
 Dill had come up also .
 "I was afraid of this . I almost did n't tell you"  .
 "If you had n't I'd have killed you"  .
 Dill's voice tightened .
 "But you ca n't ride into the Ferry . That's what they'll expect you to do . They'll be there waiting for you . I understand how you feel about the child ..."  .
 "The hell you do"  .
 Barton's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it .
 "I never saw him . My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away . "I ca n't leave him there . Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and I would n't entrust a snake to his tender care . I've got to get the boy . Let's ride"  .
 .
 BARTON'S MEN CUT the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult .
 It was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state .
 It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame .
 It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield .
 It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences .
 For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence .
 Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit .
 The office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove .
 The building was dwarfed by the scene outside .
 There a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside .
 The gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth .
 It was partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire hoses , and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices .
 A million dollars' of gold a month .
 A million tons of rock and soil and brush .
 The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day .
 Their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles .
 Hague , like all who worked near the pits , was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums .
 He was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air .
 Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt .
 Ten years older than Mitch Barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation .
 He was proud of his accomplishments , proud of his job , proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him .
 He lived and breathed for the mining company .
 No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life .
 There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room .
 Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke .
 The man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose .
 The eyes always held Hague , eyes of a dead man , lidless as a lizard's , with the fixed intensity of a cobra .
 Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke .
 He knew nothing about the man's history .
 Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger .
 Kodyke was to head the dread company police .
 He ran the change rooms .
 He threw out the hi-graders .
 He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco .
 Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike .
 He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype .
 "This is Mitchell Barton . He broke out of Folsom last night . Apparently he bribed one of the guards . We want him back there or we want him dead"  .
 .
 Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully .
 "Dangerous"  ?
 "Dangerous , yes . You know how the ranchers in the valley are . They blame us for all their troubles . Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches . It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them . We do n't want Barton's Night Riders loose again"  .
 .
 The gunman nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing .
 Normally Hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said .
 If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it .
 After they had finished eating , Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm  --  "so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle"   --  and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother .
 She had offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called "Auntie"  .
 When they reached their neighbor's house , Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought  --  of the type to which she was frequently subject these days  --  that they might never see one another again .
 Then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination .
 As she drove , she thought about her plan .
 It was really quite simple .
 So simple , in fact , that it might even work  --  although Pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance .
 That mistake , she thought , had cost her dearly these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her .
 She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest .
 When the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped .
 All of her movements were careful and methodical , partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime .
 She locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house .
 Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom .
 On her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving  --  an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , Major Hiram Munroe Culver .
 He had belonged to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it  --  and this was the only material symbol that remained of him .
 If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .
 She would return this symbol to the mountain , as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring ... or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice .
 Slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house .
 There was only one place where the mountain might receive her  --  that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom .
 Atonement , if atonement were possible , could only be made at that sacred , sacrificial basin .
 It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness .
 Perhaps it was insane , Pamela thought .
 Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream .
 But she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken .
 Facing the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool .
 She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it .
 The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand .
 The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle .
 Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time .
 It was not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all .
 No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning .
 Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed .
 Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child ... that its sympathy lay with the Culvers ... that she had erred in failing to understand this ?
 Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along .
 The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear .
 She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .
 Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them .
 A few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable .
 She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal .
 If , as she walked , her steps fumbled from time to time , she chose to ignore that omen .
 If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim , she tried not to heed .
 Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity ; she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest .
 The forest took on an impersonal aspect .
 It did not care what sort of person prowled its woods , plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes .
 Unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there  --  fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter .
 Red man or white man , pacifist or killer , the forest would accept them all  --  knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence ; knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man .
 Pamela shook her head .
 She must not think about time .
 That was another one of those traps .
 In her grim pursuit of tranquillity , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband .
 If , when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand .
 How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent ?
 Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor .
 His bright , daylight mind would whistle away such images ; they would not dare to face his scoffing .
 Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near .
 His presence would have interfered with her duty .
 The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles .
 The trees huddled more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun .
 Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass , Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction .
 Nevertheless , she continued to move upward .
 She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles .
 The forest had become an alien world where she strove , alone , unprotected , unguided , to deal with whatever hindrances were offered .
 It was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time .
 At one and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry .
 Silence came into the forest  --  a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees .
 Silence walked at Pamela's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear .
 Silence stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , blocking her retreat .
 She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth .
 In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , bruising her arm on a naked stone .
 For a moment , she could not catch her breath and then , her breath returning in short , frightened spasms , she lifted herself to her feet laboriously .
 She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes .
 Her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain .
 She looked around .
 She was bewildered .
 She seemed to have come such a long distance  --  too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees .
 She stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her .
 She was standing in a thick grove .
 The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped , virtually shutting out the sun completely .
 The earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays .
 She had the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain .
 The thought made Pamela shudder .
 A terrible chill swept through the grove .
 Not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catching Pamela in a leering embrace .
 There was a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived .
 Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene ?
 She already knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive .
 It enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles .
 It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin .
 It crawled across her breasts , suffocating the life in her nipples .
 It circled her thighs , exploring with its icy tentacles .
 It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached ; stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps ; clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws .
 She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight .
 But she did not know which way to go .
 The shadows of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove .
 She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles .
 She could not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth , who would hear , who would listen ?
 Does the mountain listen ?
 Pamela groped blindly .
 She had to escape .
 She had to move in some direction  --  any direction that would take her away from this evil place .
 She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back .
 Her own body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed .
 Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy .
 Twigs cracked loudly under her feet ; bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her .
 Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement .
 She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him .
 "I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord . I'm well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that I do n't amount to anything . But"  .
 "But it do n't matter a-tall"  , Lord supplied fondly .
 "To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the sweetest flower that grows"  .
 Beaming idiotically , he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her .
 She yanked away from him furiously .
 "You shut up !
 shu-tt up-pp !
 I've got something to say to you , and by God you're going to listen . Do you hear me ?
 You're going to listen"  .
 !
 Lord nodded agreeably .
 He said he wanted very much to listen .
 He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as pleasin' to the ear , and he did n't want to miss a word of it .
 So would she mind speaking a little louder ?
 "I think you stink , Tom Lord !
 I think you're mean and hateful and stupid , and  --  louder"  ?
 said Joyce .
 "Uh-huh . So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car . Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble"  .
 .
 He opened the door and got out .
 He waited at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly .
 "Well ?
 Was n't you goin' to say somethin'"  ?
 Then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , "Maybe you could write it down for me , huh ?
 Print it in real big letters , an' I can cipher it out later"  .
 "Aah , go on"  , she said .
 "Just go the hell on"  .
 He grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front of the car .
 Lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side .
 Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock absorber , and spring .
 He went prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination .
 After a time , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five-dollar shirt .
 He wore no gun  --  a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country .
 Never , he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun .
 And he really feels that way , she thought .
 That's really all he's got , all he is .
 Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .
 If I could make myself feel the same way ... She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis .
 Here in the God-forsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , Tom Lord looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible .
 He was handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine-chiseled features .
 But she'd known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good looks , what was there left ?
 He was n't a big man ; rather on the medium side .
 Neither was he very powerful of build .
 He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong .
 And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance .
 Just nothing , she told herself .
 Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone .
 But , by gosh , I want him and I'm going to have him !
 He caught her eye , came back around the car with the boot-wearer's teetering , half-mincing walk .
 Why did these yokels still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years ?
 He slid in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffered one to her .
 "Oh , cut it out , Tom"  !
 she snapped .
 "Ca n't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute"  ?
 "This ai n't your brand , maybe"  , Lord suggested .
 "Or maybe you just do n't feel like a cigar"  ?
 "I feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like !
 Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk"  ?
 "Might get there faster walkin'"  , Lord drawled , "seein' as how I got a busted front spring . On the other hand , howsomever , maybe you would n't either . I figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk , and I c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours"  .
 .
 "How  --  with what ?
 There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes"  .
 "Now , ai n't it the truth"  ?
 Lord laughed with secret amusement .
 "Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes , so I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me"  .
 "Tom !
 For God's sake"  !
 "Looky"  .
 He pointed , cutting her off .
 "See that wildcat"  ?
 She saw it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat  --  a test well in unexplored country .
 And even with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town .
 A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency .
 He had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others .
 "Well , let's get going"  , she said impatiently .
 "I"   --  She broke off , frowning .
 "What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ?
 Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you"  ?
 "Why , I meant what I said"  , Lord declared .
 "What else would I mean , anyways"  ?
 She looked at him , lips compressed .
 Then , with a shrug of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up .
 In his mood , it was the best way to handle him ; that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever .
 Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum  --  teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood .
 The car lurched along at a snail's crawl , the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself .
 Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel .
 He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned .
 Along with this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension .
 It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated .
 Joyce had seen him like this once before  --  more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion .
 That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company .
 Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line .
 McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip .
 He had a legitimate reason for wearing it .
 It was payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields .
 Moreover , as long as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it .
 "So what's this all about"  ?
 he demanded , when Lord confronted him .
 "I'm not the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit"  .
 It was the wrong thing to say .
 By failing to do as he was told instantly  --  to take out a permit or return the gun to his car  --  he had played into Lord's hands .
 The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest .
 The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him .
 So , "How about it"  ?
 he said .
 "Why single me out on this permit deal"  ?
 "Well , I'll tell you about that"  , Lord told him .
 "We aim t' be see-lective , y' know ?
 Do n't like to bother no one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case . Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots"  .
 .
 McBride reddened .
 He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him .
 He was an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable .
 "Look , Lord"  , he said hoarsely .
 "I know you've got a grudge against me , and maybe I ca n't blame you . You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped'em do it . But you're all wrong , man !
 I'm no lawyer . I just do what I'm told , and"  .
 "Uh-huh . An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks . So you get rid of that pistol right now , Mis-ter McBride . You do that or take you out a permit right now"  .
 .
 McBride could n't do either , of course .
 Not immediately , as the deputy demanded .
 Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes .
 To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible .
 Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot .
 How could he exert authority over them  --  make them toe the line , as he had to  --  if he knuckled under to this small-town clown ?
 "I'll get around to it a little later"  , he mumbled desperately .
 "Just as soon as I go to the bank , and"   --  "Huh-uh . Now , Mis-ter McBride"  .
 , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm .
 It was strictly the deputy's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in .
 Now , he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck .
 He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront .
 It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition .
 Lord slugged him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine .
 Then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an uppercut .
 A rabbit punch redoubled him .
 And then there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach ... But he could n't keep up with them .
 No more could he defend himself against them .
 He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen .
 And he could no longer think of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape .
 Why , he's going to kill me , he thought wildly .
 I meant him no harm .
 I've given willful hurt to no man .
 I was just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me .
 Beat me to death in front of a hundred people .
 Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .
 He , McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically .
 McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust .
 Fear-maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again .
 He could n't see ; he was long past the point of coherent thinking .
 Dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly .
 He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air .
 He hated them too much to understand  --  the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world .
 This , he was sure , was the way they would act ; laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death .
 And nothing would be done about it .
 Nothing unless ... Donna !
 Donna , his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him .
 Donna was like he was .
 She lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance .
 And Donna would  --  When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house , in the office of Doctor Lord , the deputy's deceased father .
 The Brannon outfit  --  known as the Slash-B because of its brand  --  reached Hondo Creek before sundown .
 The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground .
 Two of the new hands , a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd .
 The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda .
 They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about .
 There was some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive .
 But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit .
 It especially bothered the older hands .
 The cook , Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd .
 He'd started a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon .
 He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven .
 Supper would be ready within the hour .
 The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby .
 Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon .
 Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now .
 Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing .
 Conchita nagged at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon .
 Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday .
 He'd come alone , without his wife and child .
 He'd been in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him .
 She wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife .
 She wished that she could talk to her mother about it .
 Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it .
 But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .
 "Pat , get out of that creek !
 You too , Sean !
 Elena , you'll get mud all over your dress"  !
 Even as she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon .
 Tomas , she called him  --  as the Mexican hands did .
 He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , Luis Hernandez .
 Whatever they are talking about ?
 Conchita wondered .
 It bothered her that she probably would never know .
 Certainly , she would n't dare ask her father afterward .
 He would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs  --  as though she were a little kid like Elena !
 At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything .
 They were sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon .
 Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him .
 He held a cigarette in his right hand .
 It was burning away , forgotten .
 His face was clouded with unhappiness .
 He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do .
 They were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned .
 Finally Hernandez said , "I could offer you advice , Tomas , but you would n't heed it"  .
 "Let's hear it , anyway"  .
 "Wait a little while . Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time . Give her time to miss you . Maybe she will then come to you . After all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy . You need her even more than you need him"  .
 .
 "She wo n't change her mind"  , Brannon said .
 "John Clayton will see to that"  .
 "But after a time away from you ..."  .
 "A year , Luis ?
 Five ?
 Ten ?
 How long should I wait"  ?
 "Maybe in a year , Tomas ..."  .
 "In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to me"  , Brannon said flatly .
 "And the boy will be too much under his influence by then . I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether . Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me  --  his own father"  .
 !
 "But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good"  .
 "In my place , you'd follow such advice as you give me"  ?
 Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain .
 "That I ca n't answer , for I ca n't imagine something like this happening to me . Maybe I should withdraw my advice  --  no"  .
 ?
 Brannon looked at Hank Maguire .
 "And you ?
 What would you do in my place"  ?
 Hank shook his head .
 "I do n't know , Tom . Like Luis , I ca n't see something like this happening to me . With Maria and me , there's never any problem . Where I go , she goes  --  and the kids with us . You're going to need your woman . And the boy will need his mother . If you take the one , you'd better take both"  .
 .
 Brannon shook his head .
 "I wo n't force Beth to come against her will . But I'm going to have my son"  .
 .
 They were silent for a little while , each looking glum .
 Finally Luis Hernandez said , "What must be , must be . I am with you , of course , Tomas"  .
 .
 And Hank Maguire added , "So am I , Tom"  .
 "All right"  , Brannon said , rising .
 "We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck"  .
 Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall .
 They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm .
 During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east .
 Later , they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then , just outside Rockfork , they ran into rain .
 Those who had slickers donned them .
 The others put on old coats or ducking jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles .
 There were seven of them , enough for a show of strength  --  to run a bluff .
 It was to be nothing more than that .
 There was to be no gunplay .
 If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble , Brannon had told the others , they would withdraw  --  and he would come after his son another time .
 He did n't want to put himself outside the law .
 With him were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and Luis's son Pedro .
 The Ramirez brothers were also along .
 The seventh man was Red Hogan , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising .
 They were all good men .
 It was dark early , because of the storm .
 Also because of the storm , the streets of Rockfork were deserted .
 Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour .
 They reined in before the town marshal's office , a box-sized building on Main Street .
 A lamp burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty .
 He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there .
 "Probably just stepped out"  , he said .
 "Maybe to have supper . Red , come along . The rest of you wait here"  .
 .
 With Red Hogan , he rode to the Welcome Cafe .
 Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .
 "Not there"  , he said , getting back onto his horse .
 "Maybe he's at the hotel"  .
 They rode to the Rockfork House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street .
 They reined in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room .
 Brannon had no slicker .
 He'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked .
 But he felt no physical discomfort .
 He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .
 He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder .
 Hogan reappeared , stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal .
 Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps .
 "He's finished eating"  , Hogan said .
 "Sitting with a cup of coffee now . It should n't be long"  .
 .
 It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon .
 He and Hogan waited by the door , one to either side .
 Macklin was the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly .
 He was puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain .
 It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late .
 They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun .
 "Just come along"  , Brannon told him .
 "Do n't start anything you ca n't finish"  .
 "Now , listen"   --  Macklin began .
 "We'll talk over at your office"  .
 "Brannon , I warn you"  !
 "Let's go , Marshal"  , Brannon said , and took him by the arm .
 Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm .
 They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office .
 The other five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room .
 His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms .
 He looked at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all .
 "I'll remember you"  , he said .
 "Every last one of you . As for you , Brannon"  .
 "Put your gun on the desk , Marshal"  .
 "Now , hold on , damn it ; I wo n't"   --  Red Hogan's patience ran out .
 He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk .
 "Too much fooling around"  , he said .
 "Do n't press your luck , badge-toter"  .
 Brannon said , "Now the key to the lockup , Marshal"  .
 "Key"  ?
 Macklin said .
 "What for"  ?
 "Ca n't you guess"  ?
 Brannon said .
 "We're putting you where you wo n't come to harm . Come on  --  the key . Get it out"  .
 !
 "Damned if I will . Brannon , you've assaulted a law officer and"  .
 They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides .
 No man laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there .
 His face took on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing .
 He held out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure .
 He swore , and said , "All right . It's here in my pocket"  .
 .
 "Get it out"  , Brannon ordered .
 Then , as Macklin obeyed : "Now let's go out back"  .
 Resignedly , Macklin turned to the back door .
 They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear .
 The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron .
 It was secured by an oversized padlock .
 Macklin balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door .
 They crowded him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in .
 Once the door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building .
 He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door .
 They returned to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street .
 Its windows glowed with lamplight .
 Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark .
 He came to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun .
 "Do n't try it"  , Brannon told him , dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following .
 "Do n't get yourself killed for something that does n't concern you"  .
 He strode past the now frightened man , entered the house .
 Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering .
 The others followed Brannon inside .
 They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house .
 They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle .
 They tracked mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet .
 Their presence fouled the elegance of that room .
 And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard .
 The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing .
 For men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second .
 But the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction .
 For , with a single exception , nothing had happened to them .
 The exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis .
 After walking out to his corral that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet .
 A split second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded .
 He'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come .
 But he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted .
 There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .
 Lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing .
 He had n't even pretended to be farming his spread .
 His land had never been plowed .
 He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it .
 He had received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them .
 He had cursed at them and threatened them .
 He was a man , those neighbors testified later , who did n't have a friend in the world .
 William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone .
 "I'll be ready next time"  !
 he raged .
 "I'll be shootin' right back"  .
 He had his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again .
 This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area .
 He found nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out .
 "Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face"  !
 he exploded .
 "That's all I ask"  !
 He never got that chance .
 For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time .
 A .30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of William Lewis' chest .
 He slumped against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself .
 Two more shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground .
 An inquest was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards .
 Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting attorney , a Colonel Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning .
 It took some time to locate Horn .
 He was finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County , two counties away .
 Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment .
 But that indictment was never made .
 For Tom Horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing .
 The former scout's alibi could n't be shaken .
 The authorities had to release him .
 He immediately rode on to Cheyenne , threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends .
 "Dead center at three hundred yards , that coroner said"  !
 he'd grin .
 "Three shots in that fella'fore he hit the ground !
 You reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that"  ?
 Publicly , he denied everything .
 Privately , he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin .
 For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do .
 Tom Horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money's worth .
 A good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats .
 The company herds were being raided less often , and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted .
 But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors .
 The rustling problem was by no means solved .
 Even in the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing .
 For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on  --  a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell .
 "Fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle"  his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later .
 "Everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he did n't care who knew it  --  even after them notes came , even after he'd heard about Lewis , even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself"  !
 On the morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work .
 Haying time was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack .
 Harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping .
 Andy Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded .
 He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest .
 The hired man ran over to help his boss .
 "My God , I'm shot"  !
 Powell gasped .
 And he collapsed and died instantly .
 Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .
 He heaved the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast .
 But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing .
 A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place .
 There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .
 Not even an empty cartridge case could be found .
 Once again , Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately .
 Once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .
 Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made .
 "Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me"  , he'd blandly announce .
 "And I sort o' got a corner on the market"  .
 "Tom"  , a friend asked him once , "how come you bushwhacked them rustlers ?
 They would n't o' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down"  .
 He had lots of friends , then as always .
 Even as he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend .
 No man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo .
 "Well"  , he explained , "s'posin<apos> you was a nester swingin' the long rope ?
 Which would you be most scairt of  --  a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down"  ?
 "Yeah , I can see that"  , the friend was forced to agree .
 "But ... well , it just do n't seem sportin' somehow"  !
 "Sportin'"  !
 The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement .
 "Sportin'"  !
 he echoed again in soft wonder .
 "I seen a lot o' things in my time . I found a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls . I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink'em and squeeze him to death . But there's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just do n't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man"  .
 !
 After the first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored .
 The lesson had been learned .
 The examples were plain .
 When Fred Powell's brother-in-law , Charlie Keane , moved into the dead man's home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice : IF YOU DO N'T LEAVE THIS COUNTRY WITHIN 3 DAYS , YOUR LIFE WILL BE TAKEN THE SAME AS POWELL'S WAS .
 This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .
 Keane left , within three days .
 All through Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same .
 Houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards .
 The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow .
 No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer .
 Jury , judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated .
 For three straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known .
 It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state .
 It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him .
 For that legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man .
 The best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found .
 Rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark .
 A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest .
 One thing was certain  --  his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary .
 The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week .
 "My reputation's my stock in trade"  , Tom mentioned more than once .
 He evidently could n't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end .
 He had made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders .
 But to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure .
 Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown .
 He made their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups .
 In the cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos .
 The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life .
 The wailing , guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him .
 By 1898 , rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming .
 When several minutes had passed and Curt had n't emerged from the livery stable , Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter .
 "I have a little job for you , Charlie . I'm sure you wo n't mind doing me a small favor"  .
 .
 Brenner's voice was oily , but Summers was n't fooled .
 He moistened his lips uneasily .
 "What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner"  ?
 Brenner shrugged carelessly .
 "It's very simple . I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari . Tell her to come here to the hotel"  .
 .
 Vastly relieved , Summers nodded and started toward the door .
 "One thing , Summers"  , Brenner said .
 "You're not to mention my name . Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her"  .
 .
 Summers pulled up short , and turned around .
 "I do n't know , Mr. Brenner"  , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans .
 "It does n't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that . Could n't I just"  .
 His voice trailed off into silence .
 Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold .
 He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he had n't before noticed .
 "You know , Summers"  , he said thoughtfully .
 "Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company . If someone were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack"  .
 .
 He started toward the stairway , then turned to add , "Tell her to come to Adams's room , that Adams is in trouble . Tell her to hurry"  .
 .
 "Yes sir"  .
 His face pale , Summers headed for the street .
 Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching .
 He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside .
 The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong , but Curt did n't interpret it this way .
 A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed .
 Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding .
 From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street .
 Curt approached the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees .
 There was a light in Black's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior .
 Curt circled the house and located a barn out back .
 He could hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else .
 There was no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened .
 He opened the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him .
 Again he stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor .
 He moved ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition .
 Horse smell was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws .
 He found a match in his pocket and lit it .
 There were two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin .
 Curt snuffed out the match .
 It was certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey Black .
 Curt wanted to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner .
 He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved .
 Reaching across the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the rump .
 The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall .
 As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open .
 He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall .
 Curt moved over beside the door and waited .
 Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess's smothered curses .
 The door swung open , and Jess said sourly , "What the hell's the matter with you ?
"  The horse continued to snort .
 Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice .
 Jess cursed again , and entered the barn .
 A match flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop .
 As he crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer .
 "Before you try anything"  , he said .
 "Remember what happened to Gruller"  .
 Jess caught his breath in surprise .
 He started to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it .
 "That's the stuff"  , Curt said .
 "Just hold it that way"  .
 He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt .
 "You and I have a little talking to do , Jess . You wo n't be needing this"  .
 .
 He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster .
 "Damn you , Adams"   --  Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock .
 "We ai n't got nothing to talk about . If I do n't come back in the house , Breed's going to"  .
 "Your trigger-happy brother is n't in the house . About now he's probably having supper . That long ride the four of you took must've given him a good appetite . Now turn around so I can see your face"  .
 .
 Jess turned .
 There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen .
 "You're about as dumb as they come , Adams . I do n't know what you're up to , but when Brenner"  .
 "You can forget about Brenner , too"  , Curt said .
 "It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about"  .
 "Arbuckle"  ?
 Jess stiffened .
 "I do n't know nothin' about him"  .
 "No ?
 I suppose you do n't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; one with blood all over it , Arbuckle's blood"  .
 Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun .
 "So help me , Crouch , I'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I'm going to hear you admit killing him . Now start talking . Who told you to do it ?
 Was it Dutch Brenner"  .
 ?
 Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand .
 He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face , but did n't finish the motion .
 Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt could n't bring himself to do it .
 Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold .
 "Having all the guns makes you a big man , do n't it , Adams ?
 If we was both armed , you would n't talk so tough"  .
 "No"  ?
 Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster .
 He retreated a step and holstered his own .
 "All right , Crouch ; we're on even terms . Now draw"  .
 !
 Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face .
 The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw , but he did n't reach for the gun .
 Curt , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high .
 "Does this make it any easier , coward"  ?
 "I ai n't drawin' against you"  , Jess said thickly .
 "I heard how you outdrew Chico . I ai n't a gunslinger"  .
 .
 "No . You're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club . I just wanted to hear you say so"  .
 .
 Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides .
 He had found Curt's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it .
 Somewhere in the distance , a woman screamed .
 Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .
 He had to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate .
 Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin .
 He dropped his own beside it .
 "We'll do it another way , then"  , he said harshly .
 Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist .
 With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack .
 Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section .
 It was like hitting a sack of salt .
 Pain shout up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .
 He slammed into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning .
 An inch lower and it would have knocked him out .
 As it was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move .
 When his eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork .
 Curt twisted to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor .
 Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose .
 It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet .
 The tines broke off under Jess's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out .
 His aim was hurried ; so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head .
 By now Curt was seeing clearly again .
 He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them .
 They made Jess double over .
 When his head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall .
 The building shook , setting the lantern to swaying , and the buckskin to pitching again .
 Even Black's old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , "Jess !
 What's going on out there"  ?
 Jess did n't seem too sure himself .
 He lurched drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall .
 Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor .
 Jess had had enough .
 Blood gushed from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists .
 Curt was in almost as bad shape , but he would n't quit .
 He backed Jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront , and drew back his right fist .
 "Tell me about Arbuckle !
 You killed him , did n't you"  ?
 "It was Brenner's idea"  , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose .
 "He found out about you and Arbuckle talking . He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble"  .
 .
 "You mean anyone who stood up for his rights"  , Curt said .
 He let go of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor .
 Turning his back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope , and waved his hand in the animal's face .
 The buckskin bolted out of the stall .
 Curt moved in and picked up his gun .
 He shook loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster .
 Leaving Jess's where it lay , he left the stall .
 "Get up , Crouch . We're going someplace"  .
 .
 Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door .
 "Who's in there"  ?
 Black called fearfully .
 Curt opened the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn .
 "You're staying right here for a while . This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle . I'm going to let him tell it to somebody else"  .
 .
 He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess .
 "Get out of here . You're coming along peacefully , or I'll put a bullet in your leg"  .
 .
 Jess stumbled through the door .
 Curt followed , reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it .
 Black would have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes .
 "Where're you takin' me"  ?
 Jess asked worriedly .
 "We're going to Marshal Woods's house . Maybe if the marshal hears this himself , it'll make a difference . Somebody in this town must still have some backbone"  .
 .
 Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' glowering faces .
 "Honey"  , he whispered .
 "Soon as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and me go for a walk down by the Snake  --  all by ourselves"  .
 "Sally"  , admonished her mother , "you've got all evening to visit with Dan . His wounds need dressing now"  .
 .
 Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting .
 What a spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world .
 He released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap .
 "Got a lot to tend to , but I'll get back quick as I can"  , he assured her .
 Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen .
 Jackson was doing most of the talking .
 So long as Sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle , Dan did n't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth .
 Soon as the Burnsides moved on , he'd lead Rex down by the river ; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening .
 Damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve .
 If I had n't got Nate stopped when I did , my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell !
 He stooped , picked up his ruined hat , and pursed his lips thoughtfully .
 From the way the wound in his head was itching , Dan knew that it would heal .
 But his only hat was something else again .
 "Nate !
 Nate"  !
 he shouted .
 The Burnsides , now ready to roll , were purposefully deaf to his cry .
 "Nate"  !
 he bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him .
 "I ai n't going to fight you no more"  .
 Nate turned his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice .
 "I know you ai n't"  !
 Dan affirmed , feeling ten feet tall .
 He moved in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate's head and clamped it on his own .
 "Here's a present for you"  , he said , shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling forehead .
 "Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by"  !
 Sally left her choring to stand beside Dan .
 Slipping her hand in his , they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight .
 Much as they had to look forward to , they did n't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go .
 AT FIRST Matilda could not believe her own eyes .
 She had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness .
 And now she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon .
 Seeing them waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all .
 Then , with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon "Pa !
 Pa !
 I can see Dan . And he's with the Jacksons"  .
 !
 "What about Burnsides"  ?
 Hez asked , who still believed they'd have them to lick .
 "They ai n't even in sight"  !
 she replied .
 By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others .
 Soon they were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again .
 But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day .
 Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires .
 Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news .
 No sooner did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action .
 The wound in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals .
 From then on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food .
 Even Sally , in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of "quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag"  .
 After their supper , the evening turned into a regular "Hoe-Down"  .
 Only , they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration .
 But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle , and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting "Glory Be"  and "Hallelujah"  above their united chant of the lilting old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration .
 "Golly"  , Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators , "do n't that fiddle make you wish the Bible did n't say us Baptists ca n't dance"  ?
 "Nor Methodists , neither"  , she replied .
 "Not that it matters to me , being this far along"  .
 Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied .
 "Come spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal"  .
 At these words of sympathy and understanding , Harmony said generously , "I do n't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games"  .
 Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , "I ai n't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell , but I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles"  .
 He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers .
 "Do n't reckon there's nobody out there ,'cept maybe Dan , who can outgrip me , Harmony"  .
 With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally .
 And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , "Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell"  .
 At the sight of Sally's happy face and carefree expression , Harmony's dark , brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears .
 She was glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan .
 ... And she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod .
 But she could n't , not yet .
 Not with the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close ... .
 Out in the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , "The farmer choose his wife"  .
 With a swift swoop of his big arms , he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their "outfit"  .
 Soon the child , the dog , the cat ... and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle .
 By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them .
 No matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal .
 Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness .
 Already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains .
 Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them .
 No sooner were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep .
 For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night .
 Even the knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains .
 Next morning , they moved on again .
 "My souls' a-gracious"  !
 Gran Harrow exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load .
 "A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud"  !
 Rod and Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins .
 "Shucks , Gran"  , they said almost in unison .
 "That was n't nothing at all"  !
 Leaning forward in her chair , Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan's face .
 "How's Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising"  ?
 "Quit ragging him , Gran"  , Rod protested .
 "I ai n't ragging him"  !
 Gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip .
 "But honest-to-Betsy , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon"  .
 The two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice .
 "Rheumatics worse , Pa"  ?
 Dan asked Hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends .
 "My right leg's stiff as a board this morning"  , he replied .
 "But the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling"  .
 The three men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens' signal .
 Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock , official signboard for the Raft River turnoff , and gloated , "Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar"  .
 "Wonder what made them hurry so"  , Rod drawled , giving Dan a sly wink .
 Dan grinned , and changed the subject .
 "From now on , Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit"  .
 "Ai n't no sense you eating our dust"  , Rod protested .
 "Sally and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along"  , Dan explained .
 "Jackson recruited his critters , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up . He's got the tightest running gear in the train now . Besides ,'t ai n't no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen , so's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch"  .
 .
 Captain Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams .
 "Reckon ye're right , Dan"  , Hez called back over his shoulder .
 "I'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon"  .
 Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing , precipice-walled gorge .
 "We'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain , Harmony"  , he spoke reassuringly , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth .
 "Like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown"  .
 Out of the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn .
 Before Harmony had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs ... .
 While no larger than Dutch Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous .
 Men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about .
 Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them .
 "Gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's here at all"  , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs .
 There were no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado , not counting the lower class dives , all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters .
 Pat only nodded .
 "Take one side of the street , and I'll take the other"  , he proposed .
 "If you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in"  .
 Cobb's assent was tight .
 "You do the same . It's all I ask , Stevens"  .
 .
 Separating , they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars .
 Russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero .
 Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief .
 He tramped out of the Miners Rest with his hopes plummeting , and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street .
 The Palace was an elaborate establishment , built practically on stilts in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch .
 Behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside .
 Russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch .
 The front windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior .
 Heading for the batwings , Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside .
 Nerves tight as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits .
 Against all expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him .
 Fierce anger surged through Russ .
 He fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot .
 Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below .
 Stevens was nowhere in sight .
 Muffling an exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down .
 As luck had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared .
 "What luck , Cobb"  ?
 he said swiftly .
 Russ pointed upward .
 "He's there"  , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement .
 Hitching his cartridge belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side .
 Climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door .
 Pat pushed through first .
 Forced behind him momentarily , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside .
 His eyes widened .
 While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday .
 Carmer himself was nowhere to be seen .
 A man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card tables .
 Two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass .
 Looking the setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place .
 "Where yuh goin'"  ?
 It was the barkeep .
 Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately .
 He did not reply , going on toward the back .
 Less assured than the tall , wide-shouldered man in the lead , Cobb followed alertly , a hand on his gun butt .
 The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it .
 He said no more .
 A hall opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell .
 Pat moved into it .
 Small rooms , probably for cards , opened off on either side .
 All the doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder .
 The door was locked .
 A single kick made it spring open , shuddering .
 Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward , a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike .
 Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .
 With a bellow Carmer lunged at him .
 But he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled .
 Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan .
 He started to struggle up , heaving desperately .
 Russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach .
 Kneeling , Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned .
 "Okay , Stevens . I've drawn his fangs"  .
 , he snapped .
 "Go through his pockets , will you ?
 If we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of"  !
 Complying methodically , Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing .
 Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment .
 Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer's hat , which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell .
 Cobb got it .
 Straightening up , his eyes ablaze , he held out the battered Stetson .
 "Look at this"  !
 Inside the crown , stuffed behind the stained sweatband , could be seen thin , crumpled wads of currency .
 Carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found .
 "By golly , Stevens !
 You were right"  , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat .
 "That is , if we can be sure this is Colcord's money"   --  Pat grunted .
 "Where else would he get it ?
 Count what you've got there , Cobb . We can soon tell"  .
 .
 Russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly .
 Pat nodded .
 "It's within a hundred of what Crip had"  , he declared .
 "We know Penny spent some  --  and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on"  .
 Handing the money over , Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean .
 His glance at Gyp Carmer was disdainful .
 "Shall we get out of here"  ?
 Leaving the card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come .
 Glowering looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them .
 Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out .
 He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street .
 Neither spoke till they reached their horses .
 Pat paused there , looking across at the young fellow .
 "It'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it , Russ"  .
 He started to return it .
 To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand .
 "Not me"  , he ruled decidedly .
 I've had enough .
 It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens"  , he pursued strictly .
 "I'll shove along home"  .
 "Whatever you say"  .
 Pat swung into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered .
 "You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really"  , he observed mildly .
 "Old Crip was n't"  , retorted Cobb tartly .
 "He'll know when you tell him . But I want this to sink in awhile . Then maybe next time he wo n't be so quick on the trigger"  .
 .
 "Pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs . "You're the doctor"  .
 , he returned with a smile .
 "But I still think Penny's an awful nice girl , Russ"   --  "You do n't have to tell me"  , flashed Cobb .
 Giving the other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street .
 Pat let him go , following more leisurely .
 At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler .
 The truth was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck .
 "Penny's always glad to see me over there"  , he mused bleakly .
 Yet had he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle .
 Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events .
 "Gyp Carmer could n't have known about Colcord's money unless he was told  --  and who else would have told him"  ?
 he asked himself .
 "It's the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money . How much of an accident could that be"  .
 ?
 Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun .
 In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning .
 Hauling up , Russ listened carefully .
 Two minutes later it came again  --  a double explosion , followed by a third , sounding more distant .
 As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house .
 He tightened up in a twinkling .
 So far as he knew , only his father could be there .
 What did it mean ?
 Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm .
 His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing .
 Still a quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed .
 Setting a course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face .
 When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression .
 He knew now what he was up against .
 Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight .
 Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly .
 If he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later .
 "Over this way !
 He ai n't gone far"  !
 a harsh cry floated to him across the brush .
 A carbine cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side .
 The would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close .
 Dismounting , Russ looked about hastily .
 Toward the west this depression led toward a draw .
 Leading his pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range .
 Swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw .
 He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind .
 He had been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot .
 A shot or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot .
 A slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away .
 A second twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm .
 Another snarled close overhead .
 "Jumping Jerusalem !
 Let's get out of here"  !
 At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw .
 The long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless .
 Sweeping a look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment .
 He heard cries from behind him , but he could make out no words .
 He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it .
 Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed .
 Gradually the wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range .
 Yet he must chance it .
 He clambered out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about .
 Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions .
 And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks on the combat record .
 Every plane that could fly was sent into the air .
 Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan .
 Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target .
 Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships .
 Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte .
 Each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs .
 A weapons carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip .
 It was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes .
 No one had much to say .
 The sky glowered down at them .
 There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever .
 The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle .
 Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it .
 His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot .
 Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before .
 But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure .
 "I've got her as neat as I can"  , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders .
 "But this goddamn climate . It's for carabao not airplanes"  .
 .
 "We'll make out . Do n't you worry , chief"  .
 , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it .
 "Yeah . See you"  .
 , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing .
 The expression was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return .
 At the prearranged time , Greg started the engine and taxied out .
 From the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip .
 He wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission .
 Yet long before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky .
 Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him .
 The dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful .
 The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small .
 The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan .
 Greg's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again .
 To the west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes .
 Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray .
 Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers .
 The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it .
 He possessed the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory .
 He shivered in the warm cockpit .
 The overcast was solid above him .
 As far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it .
 They would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it did n't close in before they returned .
 Greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .
 "Todman , let's try to go under this stuff . Stay in close and we'll go up the valley"  .
 .
 "Roger , Sweeney"  , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg .
 Greg took the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf .
 He dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain .
 The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn .
 It was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia .
 The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in .
 If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .
 The formation remained perfect .
 When the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out .
 He spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast .
 Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity .
 Once Todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him .
 "Somebody beat us to it"  !
 Todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation .
 Visibility continued to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet .
 It was frustrating .
 His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights .
 He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill .
 But Greg's area remained as placid as a Florida dawn .
 Finally , as time began to run out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies .
 The low clouds made bombing difficult .
 There was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run .
 The accuracy was deplorable .
 One of Greg's bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it .
 Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .
 With their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily .
 Greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home .
 Mercifully , it was still open .
 Like a man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley .
 He was about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman's voice broke in : "Sweeneys !
 Three bogies . Twelve o'clock level"  .
 .
 Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel .
 He saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast .
 They were headed straight for each other on a collision course .
 Friend or enemy ?
 The same old question .
 And only a few seconds to answer it .
 "Zeros"  !
 Todman said excitedly , and hopefully .
 And then he thought Todman might be right .
 His mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification .
 He narrowed the shape down to two : either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft .
 If it were the enemy , tactically his position was correct .
 Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower .
 His present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages .
 But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he had n't been spotted already .
 But the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course .
 In seconds , Greg made his decision .
 He pushed the radio button .
 "Sweeney Blue , hit the deck . Lots of throttle . Todman , you take the one on the left . I'll take the middle . Belton , the one on the right . If ... if they're Japs . Let's make sure first"  .
 .
 Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two "Rogers"  .
 The planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully .
 Greg's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees .
 The opposing aircraft continued to come on .
 They appeared to be the enemy .
 Greg wished the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes .
 There was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them .
 It was a box .
 But they could turn and escape to the east .
 Greg pushed the radio button again .
 "Todman , drop your second element back . If any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces . Now let's make sure they're Japs"  .
 .
 Even as he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy .
 The shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom .
 Greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight .
 The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him .
 His hands shook .
 "Arm your guns , Sweeneys"  .
 "They're Japs . They're Japs"  .
 , came a high-pitched voice .
 "Greg to Sweeney Blue . One pass only . No turns . You'll bust your ass in this canyon . That's an order"  .
 .
 He moved the flights over against one wall .
 It gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery .
 If the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out .
 A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done .
 Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting .
 The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .
 "They have n't seen us"  , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise .
 "They have n't seen us"  .
 He hit the radio button .
 "Now , Sweeneys , now . Let's take'em home"  .
 .
 He hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag .
 Out of the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him .
 Perfect , he thought .
 With the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done .
 Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board .
 He tightened his turn .
 His nose up .
 It was going to be dangerous .
 Eight aircraft in this small box .
 Please , dear God , make my pilots good , he prayed .
 He took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another .
 The enemy did not veer .
 It did not seem possible that they had n't been spotted .
 Blind fools .
 Now !
 Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger .
 The plane rumbled and slowed .
 Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished .
 As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them .
 Greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered .
 Luck was with him .
 His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane .
 The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces .
 A large piece of engine cowling vanished .
 It was all Greg had time to see .
 His maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds .
 His speed was dropping rapidly .
 If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground .
 Wingman , stay clear , he prayed .
 He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back .
 He fought the panic of vertigo .
 He had no idea which was up and which was down .
 He held the controls where they had been .
 Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip .
 His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .
 Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife .
 If it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick .
 I worked for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter .
 The arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day .
 The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting .
 I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun .
 I had come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there .
 When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted .
 The arrangement turned out to be excellent .
 I loved the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras .
 I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner .
 The very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure .
 It was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with masks and go adventuring .
 My Uncle and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages .
 Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything .
 One Monday morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt .
 They were married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty .
 She looked more like twenty-five or six .
 It was really a May and December combination .
 My new Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex .
 There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked  --  there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me .
 Her legs were the full , sexy kind , full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite ; the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect .
 You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body .
 The true artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body .
 The artist looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind's eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is .
 And that is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store .
 That she impressed me instantly was obvious ; I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them .
 I thought I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks .
 True , she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care .
 She was standing with her back to the glass door .
 Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired .
 As it is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something clicks .
 Something clicked in this instance , but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance .
 When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it .
 And then I became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously .
 I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model .
 I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship .
 When our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of "Me , too"  .
 You have probably experienced this .
 It is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity .
 Why she married him I do not know .
 I myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me .
 He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living .
 Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; some women with father fixations do .
 For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home ; his bride opened the store .
 I was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition .
 Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .
 The cavernous depth , cluttered with antiques , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk .
 She placed her palms , fingers outspread , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , "Now , what next"  ?
 I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune .
 There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
 I was standing beside her , watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped .
 I bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush .
 Her mouth , which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender .
 I heard her murmur , "We'd better lock the door"  .
 It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .
 When we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said : "He will not always be indisposed"  .
 "I know . I was thinking about that . How will we work it out"  .
 ?
 "I do n't know"  , she said .
 "You're the man . You figure it out . I've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met"  .
 .
 "I guess we both felt it"  .
 I said .
 "I guess so"  , she said .
 "But now what"  ?
 Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable .
 "I know what we can do"  , I said .
 "Tell him I made a pass at you"  .
 She raised a protesting hand with a startled air .
 "What are you trying to do ?
 Get thrown out ?
 If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew  --  and not even a blood nephew"  ?
 "I do n't want to be thrown out and I do n't think I will . I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us"  .
 .
 "By telling him you are making passes at me"  ?
 she said incredulously .
 "When I was in college"  , I grinned , "I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class . I do n't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets . In those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell ; and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us . Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially . A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball . There will be romance and flirtation . If you tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am . We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain . And to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead . You are both the same size . He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask . When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it"  .
 .
 "But you"   --  she began .
 "Do n't worry about me . It will turn out all right"  .
 .
 "I do n't understand"  , she insisted .
 "Are you trying to cut your throat"  ?
 "No"  , I chuckled , "I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education"  .
 As we expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning .
 I felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife .
 I quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days .
 I heard subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date .
 Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .
 A few minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner .
 I must say the figure was well made up .
 If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him .
 In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .
 I suspected why he brought it along .
 In the half darkness I approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me .
 He was looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without wasting words I smacked him hard across the face .
 "You cheap bitch"  !
 I exclaimed .
 "You cheap , no good , two-timing bitch !
 You get a good , loyal husband  --  smack !
  --  and you fall for a pass by his own nephew !
 You should  --  smack !
