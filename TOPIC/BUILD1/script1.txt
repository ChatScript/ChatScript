The government has major get-togethers to avoid answering questions. They are called press conferences. And they speak in euphemisms to avoid saying the truth. What did I misunderstand? `01A u: ( do not avoid ) [ Why not? ] [ Avoiding is half the challenge. ] [ Is there a penalty if I fail to? ] `01Q u: ( do not make_sense ) [ So what if it doesn't make sense? ] [ Many things that don't make sense turn out to be true. ] `01- a: ( [ ~example what should ] ) Does it make sense that we build our lives around cheap gasoline that is inevitably going to run out someday? `01F ?: ( do you not agree ) [ Of course I agree. ] [ The logic is irrefutable. ] [ Why does my agreement matter? ] `01n s: ( I do not plan ) [ Plans aren't everything. ] [ Many things happen that are unplanned. ] `02I u: 9CANTYOU ( I < * can * not < !~qwords ) [ You can't? ] [ b: Is it that you can't or that you won't? ] [ Why not? ] [ Maybe you will learn how someday. ] [ Other people can. ] [ I can. ] `00H b: ( can * not ) Are you handicapped? `00# b: ( will * not ) So it's just obstinacy on your part then. `00P b: ( both ) That covers it pretty thoroughly. `010 b: ( neither ) Hey.
